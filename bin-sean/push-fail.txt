remote:  Revert the changes from commit 913034d3b8e69c90d0080b4ddcd859bc09778e18. This
remote:  was not a simple revert via git but rather a manual revert back to the
remote:  ethsw driver using phylib to control the phys on the switch.
remote:
remote:  Removed the use of the 53xxx phy driver as it incorporates switch core
remote:  control that conflicts with our ethsw switch driver.
remote:
remote:  Added the 53124/5 phy ID to the bcm7xxx phy7 driver so it is used for
remote:  the 3390 internal phys, the 53124/5, and 53134 external switch phys.
remote:
remote:  Changed the ethsw driver reference to the phys to allow it to correctly
remote:  associate the right phy at the right address with a switch port.

remote:  netfilter: conntrack: remove central spinlock nf_conntrack_lock
remote:
remote:  nf_conntrack_lock is a monolithic lock and suffers from huge contention
remote:  on current generation servers (8 or more core/threads).
remote:
remote:  Perf locking congestion is clear on base kernel:
remote:
remote:  -  72.56%  ksoftirqd/6  [kernel.kallsyms]    [k] _raw_spin_lock_bh
remote:     - _raw_spin_lock_bh
remote:        + 25.33% init_conntrack
remote:        + 24.86% nf_ct_delete_from_lists
remote:        + 24.62% __nf_conntrack_confirm
remote:        + 24.38% destroy_conntrack
remote:        + 0.70% tcp_packet
remote:  +   2.21%  ksoftirqd/6  [kernel.kallsyms]    [k] fib_table_lookup
remote:  +   1.15%  ksoftirqd/6  [kernel.kallsyms]    [k] __slab_free
remote:  +   0.77%  ksoftirqd/6  [kernel.kallsyms]    [k] inet_getpeer
remote:  +   0.70%  ksoftirqd/6  [nf_conntrack]       [k] nf_ct_delete
remote:  +   0.55%  ksoftirqd/6  [ip_tables]          [k] ipt_do_table
remote:
remote:  This patch change conntrack locking and provides a huge performance
remote:  improvement.  SYN-flood attack tested on a 24-core E5-2695v2(ES) with
remote:  10Gbit/s ixgbe (with tool trafgen):
remote:
remote:   Base kernel:   810.405 new conntrack/sec
remote:   After patch: 2.233.876 new conntrack/sec
remote:
remote:  Notice other floods attack (SYN+ACK or ACK) can easily be deflected using:
remote:   # iptables -A INPUT -m state --state INVALID -j DROP
remote:   # sysctl -w net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_tcp_loose=0
remote:
remote:  Use an array of hashed spinlocks to protect insertions/deletions of
remote:  conntracks into the hash table. 1024 spinlocks seem to give good
remote:  results, at minimal cost (4KB memory). Due to lockdep max depth,
remote:  1024 becomes 8 if CONFIG_LOCKDEP=y
remote:
remote:  The hash resize is a bit tricky, because we need to take all locks in
remote:  the array. A seqcount_t is used to synchronize the hash table users
remote:  with the resizing process.

remote:  netfilter: avoid race with exp->master ct
remote:
remote:  Preparation for disconnecting the nf_conntrack_lock from the
remote:  expectations code.  Once the nf_conntrack_lock is lifted, a race
remote:  condition is exposed.
remote:
remote:  The expectations master conntrack exp->master, can race with
remote:  delete operations, as the refcnt increment happens too late in
remote:  init_conntrack().  Race is against other CPUs invoking
remote:  ->destroy() (destroy_conntrack()), or nf_ct_delete() (via timeout
remote:  or early_drop()).
remote:
remote:  Avoid this race in nf_ct_find_expectation() by using atomic_inc_not_zero(),
remote:  and checking if nf_ct_is_dying() (path via nf_ct_delete()).

remote:  netfilter: conntrack: remove central spinlock nf_conntrack_lock
remote:
remote:  nf_conntrack_lock is a monolithic lock and suffers from huge contention
remote:  on current generation servers (8 or more core/threads).
remote:
remote:  Perf locking congestion is clear on base kernel:
remote:
remote:  -  72.56%  ksoftirqd/6  [kernel.kallsyms]    [k] _raw_spin_lock_bh
remote:     - _raw_spin_lock_bh
remote:        + 25.33% init_conntrack
remote:        + 24.86% nf_ct_delete_from_lists
remote:        + 24.62% __nf_conntrack_confirm
remote:        + 24.38% destroy_conntrack
remote:        + 0.70% tcp_packet
remote:  +   2.21%  ksoftirqd/6  [kernel.kallsyms]    [k] fib_table_lookup
remote:  +   1.15%  ksoftirqd/6  [kernel.kallsyms]    [k] __slab_free
remote:  +   0.77%  ksoftirqd/6  [kernel.kallsyms]    [k] inet_getpeer
remote:  +   0.70%  ksoftirqd/6  [nf_conntrack]       [k] nf_ct_delete
remote:  +   0.55%  ksoftirqd/6  [ip_tables]          [k] ipt_do_table
remote:
remote:  This patch change conntrack locking and provides a huge performance
remote:  improvement.  SYN-flood attack tested on a 24-core E5-2695v2(ES) with
remote:  10Gbit/s ixgbe (with tool trafgen):
remote:
remote:   Base kernel:   810.405 new conntrack/sec
remote:   After patch: 2.233.876 new conntrack/sec
remote:
remote:  Notice other floods attack (SYN+ACK or ACK) can easily be deflected using:
remote:   # iptables -A INPUT -m state --state INVALID -j DROP
remote:   # sysctl -w net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_tcp_loose=0
remote:
remote:  Use an array of hashed spinlocks to protect insertions/deletions of
remote:  conntracks into the hash table. 1024 spinlocks seem to give good
remote:  results, at minimal cost (4KB memory). Due to lockdep max depth,
remote:  1024 becomes 8 if CONFIG_LOCKDEP=y
remote:
remote:  The hash resize is a bit tricky, because we need to take all locks in
remote:  the array. A seqcount_t is used to synchronize the hash table users
remote:  with the resizing process.

remote:  netfilter: avoid race with exp->master ct
remote:
remote:  Preparation for disconnecting the nf_conntrack_lock from the
remote:  expectations code.  Once the nf_conntrack_lock is lifted, a race
remote:  condition is exposed.
remote:
remote:  The expectations master conntrack exp->master, can race with
remote:  delete operations, as the refcnt increment happens too late in
remote:  init_conntrack().  Race is against other CPUs invoking
remote:  ->destroy() (destroy_conntrack()), or nf_ct_delete() (via timeout
remote:  or early_drop()).
remote:
remote:  Avoid this race in nf_ct_find_expectation() by using atomic_inc_not_zero(),
remote:  and checking if nf_ct_is_dying() (path via nf_ct_delete()).

remote:          brcmstb_defconfig: Compress kernel with XZ instead of GZIP
remote:
remote:          GZIP is the default kernel compression method, while it is a good tradeoff
remote:          between compression ratio and speed, recent additions to the default kernel
remote:          have made us get too close from the 4MB size, which is the typical "kernel"
remote:          partition provided by BOLT. Until we can afford not caring about size, switch
remote:          to the strongest compression algorithm that is supported: XZ, putting us back
remote:          into the safe zone for a while.

remote:          gpio: brcmstb: Fix wake-up on GPIO interrupts
remote:
remote:          The current driver was missing a few key things to allow GPIO interrupts to be
remote:          properly used as wake-up sources as intended:
remote:
remote:          - the IRQCHIP_MASK_ON_SUSPEND should only apply to the non wake-up capable
remote:            controllers
remote:          - we need to know which GPIO interrupt line is requested to be a
remote:            wake-up source, and program its interrupt mask accordingly to make it able to
remote:            wake-up the system
remote:
remote:          In order to accomplish that, we introduce a per-GPIO bank bitmask of active
remote:          sources (wake_active) and program it into GIO_MASK when we are about to
remote:          suspend.

remote:          xfs: remote attribute overwrite causes transaction overrun
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 8275cdd0e7ac550dcce2b3ef6d2fb3b808c1ae59]
remote:
remote:          Commit e461fcb ("xfs: remote attribute lookups require the value
remote:          length") passes the remote attribute length in the xfs_da_args
remote:          structure on lookup so that CRC calculations and validity checking
remote:          can be performed correctly by related code. This, unfortunately has
remote:          the side effect of changing the args->valuelen parameter in cases
remote:          where it shouldn't.
remote:
remote:          That is, when we replace a remote attribute, the incoming
remote:          replacement stores the value and length in args->value and
remote:          args->valuelen, but then the lookup which finds the existing remote
remote:          attribute overwrites args->valuelen with the length of the remote
remote:          attribute being replaced. Hence when we go to create the new
remote:          attribute, we create it of the size of the existing remote
remote:          attribute, not the size it is supposed to be. When the new attribute
remote:          is much smaller than the old attribute, this results in a
remote:          transaction overrun and an ASSERT() failure on a debug kernel:
remote:
remote:          XFS: Assertion failed: tp->t_blk_res_used <= tp->t_blk_res, file: fs/xfs/xfs_trans.c, line: 331
remote:
remote:          Fix this by keeping the remote attribute value length separate to
remote:          the attribute value length in the xfs_da_args structure. The enables
remote:          us to pass the length of the remote attribute to be removed without
remote:          overwriting the new attribute's length.
remote:
remote:          Also, ensure that when we save remote block contexts for a later
remote:          rename we zero the original state variables so that we don't confuse
remote:          the state of the attribute to be removes with the state of the new
remote:          attribute that we just added. [Spotted by Brain Foster.]

remote:          BCMGENET: Power up the internal PHY before probing the MII
remote:
remote:          When using the internal PHY it must be powered up when the MII is probed
remote:          or the PHY will not be detected.  Since the PHY is powered up at reset
remote:          this has not been a problem.  However, when the kernel is restarted with
remote:          kexec the PHY will likely be powered down when the kernel starts so it
remote:          will not be detected and the Ethernet link will not be established.
remote:
remote:          This commit explicitly powers up the internal PHY when the GENET driver
remote:          is probed to correct this behavior.

remote:
remote:          If, after the program has run, there something like the following line in

remote:
remote:          with a usage count of 100 * the number of times the program has been run,
remote:          then the kernel is malfunctioning.  If leaked-keyring has zero usages or
remote:          has been garbage collected, then the problem is fixed.

remote:
remote:          When generating an address for bmem_find_region() from a pfn value we

remote:          by the bmem_find_region() function before performing the left shift.
remote:
remote:          Otherwise, there is a risk that the PAGE_SHIFT to the left will cause
remote:          meaningful bits of the pfn value to overflow the unsigned long data
remote:          type causing the address to unintentionally wrap.  This in turn can
remote:          cause a highmem address above 4GB to wrap back into the 4GB range and
remote:          be mistaken for being within a BMEM/BRCMSTB_CMA region.

remote:
remote:          This commit adds MSI functionality to the BrcmSTB PCIe hardware.  The
remote:          code is influenced by the MSI implementation as seen in pcie-rcar.c.
remote:
remote:          This MSI implementation is complicated by two factors:
remote:
remote:          1. we have multiple root controllers (RC), each with their own MSI
remote:
remote:          2. we have some chips implemented where the PCIe interrupt is shared
remote:          with the MSI interrupt.  In addition, the MSI interrupt bits do
remote:          not have their own register; there are 8 bits starting at position
remote:          24 in the L2 interrupt register.

remote:          usb: USB 3.0 device as rootfs fails to recover after S2 or S3
remote:
remote:          On systems using IPP (Invert Port Power), mounted USB 3.0
remote:          devices will get re-enumerated on S3 resume and the mounted
remote:          filesystem will no longer be accessible. This is happening
remote:          because a system using IPP will power up with USB power
remote:          enabled to the USB devices until the IPP can be set by software.
remote:          This is enough time for 3.0 devices to timeout on the 3.0
remote:          connect attempt (because the 3.0 PHY has not yet been enabled)
remote:          and fall back to a 2.0 device. This shouldn't be a problem
remote:          because the 3.0 devices in 2.0 mode would normally be power
remote:          cycled after the software sets IPP correctly, but the USB driver
remote:          turns on device power so quickly after we set IPP that the device
remote:          doesn't see the power cycle (on a 7445SV board it takes about
remote:          8ms for power to drop to zero). This change adds a 50ms delay
remote:          when IPP is being set. The delay is only added if IPP was not
remote:          already set to avoid delays if BOLT already set IPP.

remote:          gpio: brcmstb: define irq_disable service
remote:
remote:          The gpiolib irqchip helpers will use irq_unmask if irq_enable is not
remote:          defined.  However, when using the handle_simple_irq() generic handler
remote:          the irq_disable service will not use irq_mask to disable the interrupt.
remote:
remote:          When using the handle_simple_irq() generic handler it should be enough
remote:          to define irq_enable and irq_disable, but since we are using the flag
remote:          IRQCHIP_MASK_ON_SUSPEND we need to define the irq_mask as well.
remote:
remote:          This commit just defines irq_disabled the same as irq_mask so that
remote:          calls to disable_irq for gpio interrupts will mask the interrupt.

remote:          Adding support to take care of this difference. Accordingly added
remote:          the compatible string for SoCs using the "Peripheral" I2C block.

remote:          pstore/ram: Strip ramoops header for correct decompression
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit a28726b4fb624f81d637a8afb9ea12fc16500f61]
remote:
remote:          pstore compression/decompression was added during 3.12.
remote:          The ramoops driver prepends a "====timestamp.timestamp-C|D\n"
remote:          header to the compressed record before handing it over to pstore
remote:          driver which doesn't know about the header. In pstore_decompress(),
remote:          the pstore driver reads the first "==" as a zlib header, so the
remote:          decompression always fails. For example, this causes the driver
remote:          to write /dev/pstore/dmesg-ramoops-0.enc.z instead of
remote:          /dev/pstore/dmesg-ramoops-0.
remote:
remote:          This patch makes the ramoops driver remove the header before
remote:          pstore decompression.

remote:          thermal: brcmstb_thermal: represent temperatures with int data type
remote:
remote:          The brcmstb_thermal driver was not properly handling computations of
remote:          negative temperatures.  This was partly attributable to inconsistency
remote:          in the v3.14 kernel thermal API which largely defines temperatures to
remote:          be unsigned.
remote:
remote:          Later versions of the kernel have cleaned up the thermal API to always
remote:          represent temperatures with type int.  This commit changes the internal
remote:          representations of temperatures within the driver to use type int and
remote:          corrects the bounds checking and computations accordingly.

remote:          mtd: brcmstb_nand:: Detect sticky ucorrectable ECC errors on DMA reads
remote:
remote:          This change provides a workaround for [CRNAND-32] where nand controller
remote:          could have a possible sticky error after a PIO and a following DMA read. As
remote:          part of [CRNAND-57] we could do a PIO to verify erased page uncorr ecc
remote:          erorr to eliminate false positives.  But this has a side effect of running into
remote:          CRNAND-32. The fix retries a DMA if we see a uncorr_ecc after a DMA read
remote:          transactiion to overcome CRNAND-32 first and then deal with CRNAND-57 as usual.

remote:          ARM: mmu: fix default vmalloc size for < 1GiB
remote:
remote:          The current default vmalloc size has been bumped up to
remote:          744MiB for platforms with >= 1 GiB (and if more than one
remote:          meminfo bank exists). As the memory banks > 760MiB (the
remote:          maximum lowmem size for a 3:1 kernel split) are split at
remote:          the lowmem/highmem boundary, the automatic bmem reservation
remote:          scheme breaks when 760MiB < memory size < 1GiB.
remote:
remote:          For example, if the bank size is 768MiB, it's split into
remote:          a 760MiB lowmem and 8MiB highmem bank. The bmem reservation
remote:          algorithm keeps all of the 760MiB for the system and only
remote:          ends up reserving 8MiB for bmem.
remote:
remote:          This patch sets the default vmalloc size for memory banks
remote:          > 760MiB to 744MiB. The change ensures the bmem automatic
remote:          reservation algorithm works correctly for 760MiB < memory
remote:          size < 1GiB.

remote:          brcmstb: memory: fix default bmem reservation
remote:
remote:          On single memory bank platforms, 20% of the available
remote:          memory is set aside for the system and the rest is reserved
remote:          as bmem. This scheme doesn't work well for very low memory
remote:          profiles (e.g. 256MiB), resulting in OOM conditions.
remote:
remote:          This patches adds the following changes to single memory
remote:          bank configurations:
remote:
remote:          - For bank sizes less than or equal to 128MiB, all memory
remote:          is allocated to the system and bmem reservation is skipped.
remote:
remote:          - For bank sizes larger than 128MiB,
remote:          reserved_bmem = 80% x (bank_size - 128MiB).

remote:
remote:          The current Broadcom USB drivers (ohci, ehci, xhci and bdc) are setup
remote:          as child drivers to a USB wrapper driver. The wrapper driver handles
remote:          any global USB controller setup and then starts the child drivers. This
remote:          change will replace the wrapper driver with a usb-phy driver that will
remote:          do the global USB controller setup and the child drivers will become
remote:          normal drivers started by the device tree parser. The new functionality
remote:          requires a new style of USB Device Tree node descriptions and will
remote:          only work with a matching version of BOLT. The kernel will also support
remote:          the old style DT entries so it will work correctly with either version
remote:          of BOLT.

remote:          mmc: Add ability to change driver strength from a Device Tree prop
remote:
remote:          Customers are requesting the ability to change the Host and Card
remote:          Driver Type (drive strength) because they are seeing interference
remote:          with WiFi and having Certification issues. This change allows new
remote:          Device Tree properties to change the default Driver Type for both
remote:          Host and Card. Not all cards support all Driver Types and if the
remote:          requested type is not supported the default will continue to be used.
remote:          The SD spec states that only UHS modes use selectable driver strength,
remote:          but our host controller allows it for HS mode as well. A customer
remote:          has requested support for the HS setting so an additional device
remote:          tree property was added for this.
remote:
remote:          The Device Tree properties that control the drive strength are:
remote:          "host-driver-strength", "host-hs-driver-strength" and
remote:          "card-driver-strength". These properties can have the value
remote:          "A", "B", "C", or "D". Where A is x1.5, B is x1.0 (default),
remote:          C is x0.75 and D is x0.5
remote:
remote:          NOTES
remote:           o Reducing Drive Strength may result in read/write errors
remote:             depending on the board design.
remote:           o The Host side settings are not supported on the 74371, which
remote:             uses the older version of the SDIO core.

remote:          clk: Remove ordering restrictions for software clocks
remote:
remote:          After using "kexec" to load and run a new kernel, the new kernel
remote:          doesn't work normally.
remote:          1. It can't detect the plug/unplug of usb disk/ethernet cable.
remote:          2. If run with a usb disk plugged, there will be kernel panic.
remote:
remote:          This is the result of Software Clocks not setting up their parents
remote:          correctly when booting via kexec. The prevents the parent
remote:          clocks of the sw clock from being enabled. This is happening because
remote:          kexec uses /proc/device-tree to reconstruct the FDT that is used
remote:          to boot the new kernel and this changes the original node order to be
remote:          alphabetical and the clock software depends on the parent clock nodes
remote:          being defined before the software clock. This change removes the
remote:          ordering restriction and allows sw clocks and parents to be
remote:          defined in any order.

remote:          net: dsa: bcm_sf2: Fix ageing conditions and operation
remote:
remote:          The comparison check between cur_hw_state and hw_state is currently
remote:          invalid because cur_hw_state is right shifted by G_MISTP_SHIFT, while
remote:          hw_state is not, so we end-up comparing bits 2:0 with bits 7:5, which is
remote:          going to cause an additional aging to occur. Fix this by not shifting
remote:          cur_hw_state while reading it, but instead, mask the value with the
remote:          appropriately shitfted bitmask.
remote:
remote:          The other problem with the fast-ageing process is that we did not set
remote:          the EN_AGE_DYNAMIC bit to request the ageing to occur for dynamically
remote:          learned MAC addresses. Finally, write back 0 to the FAST_AGE_CTRL
remote:          register to avoid leaving spurious bits sets from one operation to the
remote:          other.

remote:
remote:          Configuring the ethtool tx-frames property, which translates into N
remote:          packets before a TX interrupt is the simplest configuration scheme
remote:          because it requires no locking neither at the softare nor hardware
remote:          level, and is completely indepedent from the link speed. Since ethtool
remote:          does not allow per-tx queue coalescing parameters, we apply the same
remote:          setting to any transmit queue.
remote:
remote:          We can no longer enable the BDONE/PDONE interrupts as those would fire
remote:          for each packet/buffer received, which would defeat the MBDONE interrupt
remote:          purpose. The MBDONE interrupt is guaranteed to correspond to a
remote:          PDONE/BDONE interrupt when the threshold is set to 1, but offers
remote:          interrupt coalescing when the value is > 1.
remote:
remote:          Since the HW is configured to generate an interrupt when the ring
remote:          becomes emtpy, we have to deny any timeout/timer settings coming from
remote:          user-space to indicate we can only generate an interrupt very <N>
remote:          packets.
remote:
remote:          While we are at it, fix the DMA_INTR_THRESHOLD_MASK value which was off
remote:          by one bit (0xff vs. 0x1ff).

remote:          [Upstream commit 00159f19a5057cb779146afce1cceede692af346]
remote:
remote:          Do not emit EV_SYN/SYN_REPORT on suspend if there were no keys that are
remote:          still pressed as we are suspending the device (and in all other cases when
remote:          input core is forcibly releasing keys via input_dev_release_keys() call).

remote:
remote:          The driver was doing direct manipulation of a pointer to the iomapped region as

remote:          spi: brcmstb-mspi: remove unnecessary check for new params in spi_transfer
remote:
remote:          The speed, mode, and bits per word should never change in the middle of a
remote:          spi_transfer.  Checking for that in the loop within write_to_hw() was a
remote:          holdover from this function was called from transfer() in the dual bspi/mspi
remote:          driver, where it was necessary because that would handle multiple spi_transfers
remote:          at a time and it was important to know when to break.  Now that we're using
remote:          transfer_one(), remove the unnecessary test.
remote:
remote:          Also, it was misleading to have a function named ..._update_parms when calling
remote:          it one way was actually just a test that wouldn't actually update any
remote:          parameters.  Now it becomes a single-purpose function that fits its name.

remote:          spi: brcmstb-mspi: fix completion timeout
remote:
remote:          We had the timeout set as msecs_to_jiffies(10), and were seeing bad timeout
remote:          values.  Now, with CONFIG_HZ=100, a jiffy is ~10 ms, so msecs_to_jiffies(10)
remote:          ends up returning 1 jiffy.  Unfortunately, if I understand correctly, waiting
remote:          for a single jiffy isn't that effective, because it means you could be waiting
remote:          for basically no time at all, depending on when your operation is scheduled to
remote:          occur.  This matches up with what we were seeing, which is that when several
remote:          SPI writes were scheduled in sequence, it would consistently fail after several
remote:          ms, which suggests the following:
remote:
remote:          time
remote:           |
remote:           v                                       tick occurs
remote:           |
remote:           v        other things happen
remote:           |
remote:           v        SPI write starts
remote:           |
remote:           v        SPI write finishes
remote:           |
remote:           v        next SPI write starts
remote:           |                                       tick occurs
remote:           v        SPI write is considered to have timed out
remote:
remote:          Increase the timeout to 11 (which will be rounded up to 2 jiffies) seems to
remote:          make this problem go away entirely, which further supports this idea.  But
remote:          looking at a sampling of SPI bus drivers in drivers/spi/ suggests that it's
remote:          probably just best to set a larger timeout value, so let's set it to HZ (will
remote:          result in 1s timeout).

remote:          spi: Add Broadcom MSPI controller driver
remote:
remote:          Some comments that are NOT FOR UPSTREAM, explaining what was changed from
remote:          original spi-brcmstb driver:
remote:
remote:          - removes BSPI support (this should be made into a proper spi-nor framework
remote:            driver), which means we don't poke EBI CS anymore
remote:          - removes EBI CS switching, which is only needed for memory mapping
remote:          - add write lock field for use with BSPI
remote:          - use the BCM7120 L2 driver instead of twiddling L2 directly from here
remote:          - get rid of useless debug prints and unused fields
remote:          - use newer transfer_one spi core API
remote:          - use spi_transfer_is_last() instead of directly checking transfer_list
remote:          - remove unnecessary state and locking
remote:          - add timeout to wait_for_completion
remote:          - request mspi_done IRQ
remote:
remote:          Changes added by Gregory and Florian:
remote:
remote:          Until the spi-nor framework is used to allow using BSPI with this
remote:          driver, the spi-brcmstb driver, if enabled, should be used for HIF SPI
remote:          (MSPI+BSPI) instead.  This will then only be used when the compatible
remote:          string is "brcm,spi-brcmstb-mspi".

remote:          BCMGENET: Fix error path in bcmgenet_mii_new_dt_init()
remote:
remote:          In case we parse the 'phy-mode' property, that is, of_get_phy_mode() returned
remote:          an error, we will take the "out" label, call mdiobus_unregister(), and then
remote:          return an error code. bcmgenet_mii_init() will take the "out" label as well and
remote:          call bcmgenet_mii_exit() calling bcmgenet_mii_free() which calls
remote:          mdiobus_unregister() a second time.
remote:
remote:          We would hit the BUG() condition on the mii_bus structure 'state' member and
remote:          crash the kernel.
remote:
remote:          Fix this by removing the mdiobus_unregister() call in
remote:          bcmgenet_mii_new_dt_init() since it duplicates the existing error path.

remote:          watchdog_dev: Change watchdog naming to be consistent with alias
remote:
remote:          There isn't a way to differentiate multiple watchdogs because
remote:          the naming scheme is done through watchdog_dev. This change uses
remote:          the alias ID for the watchdog name. This makes it easy to cross
remote:          reference the watchdog with the device tree alias so we can know
remote:          which watchdog we are using.
remote:
remote:          If no alias is defined, the watchdog will use the default naming
remote:          scheme.

remote:          ARM: v7 setup function should invalidate L1 cache
remote:
remote:          All ARMv5 and older CPUs invalidate their caches in the early assembly
remote:          setup function, prior to enabling the MMU.  This is because the L1
remote:          cache should not contain any data relevant to the execution of the
remote:          kernel at this point; all data should have been flushed out to memory.
remote:
remote:          This requirement should also be true for ARMv6 and ARMv7 CPUs - indeed,
remote:          these typically do not search their caches when caching is disabled (as
remote:          it needs to be when the MMU is disabled) so this change should be safe.
remote:
remote:          ARMv7 allows there to be CPUs which search their caches while caching is
remote:          disabled, and it's permitted that the cache is uninitialised at boot;
remote:          for these, the architecture reference manual requires that an
remote:          implementation specific code sequence is used immediately after reset
remote:          to ensure that the cache is placed into a sane state.  Such
remote:          functionality is definitely outside the remit of the Linux kernel, and
remote:          must be done by the SoC's firmware before _any_ CPU gets to the Linux
remote:          kernel.
remote:
remote:          Changing the data cache clean+invalidate to a mere invalidate allows us
remote:          to get rid of a lot of platform specific hacks around this issue for
remote:          their secondary CPU bringup paths - some of which were buggy.

remote:          - Check in brcmstb_boot_secondary that we actually had the required DT nodes

remote:          We still need to check that we actually have a vma beforehand though.  Also,
remote:          the next_page label in __get_user_pages() (GUP) already handles accounting so we'd
remote:          like to just jump there and not duplicate the logic.  While looking at that, I
remote:          realized that we were unnecessarily re-finding the current vma every iteration,
remote:          which should only be necessary when first calling GUP or when crossing a vma
remote:          bound, so by changing to jump to next_page and instead also calling
remote:          brcmstb_get_page() in the inner loop, that should help to optimize GUP for BMEM
remote:          and CMA.

remote:          libata: skip debounce delay on link resume
remote:
remote:          The link resume logic uses a 200msec delay while debouncing
remote:          the SControl register. The rationale behind that delay is
remote:          to accomodate some PHYs that behave badly if their SStatus/

remote:          The Broadcom STB SATA PHY does not seem to have this issue.
remote:          This patch introduces a new link flag that allows platforms
remote:          to skip the debounce delay if it isn't needed.

remote:          BCMGENET: enable MoCA link state change detection
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 8d88c6ebb34c3e54debe81e9b0d81b60411f8179]
remote:
remote:          Currently, MoCA fixed PHYs are always in link-up state, regardless of
remote:          whether the link is actually up or not.
remote:
remote:          Add code to properly detect MoCA link state changes and to reflect the
remote:          new state in MoCA fixed PHY. Only GENET V3 and V4 MACs are capable of
remote:          detecting MoCA link state changes.
remote:
remote:          The code works as follows:
remote:          1. GENET MAC detects MoCA link state change and issues UMAC_IRQ_LINK_UP
remote:             or UMAC_IRQ_LINK_DOWN interrupt.
remote:          2. Link up/down interrupt is processed in bcmgenet_irq_task(), which
remote:             calls phy_mac_interrupt().
remote:          3. phy_mac_interrupt() updates the fixed PHY phydev->link and kicks
remote:             the PHY state machine.
remote:          4. PHY state machine proceeds to read the fixed PHY link status
remote:             register.
remote:          5. When the fixed PHY link status register is being read, the new
remote:             function bcmgenet_fixed_phy_link_update() gets called. It copies
remote:             the fixed PHY phydev->link value to the fixed PHY status->link.
remote:          6. PHY state machine receives the new link state of the fixed PHY.
remote:          7. MoCA fixed PHY link state now correctly reflects the real MoCA
remote:             hardware link state.

remote:          drivers: ata: wake port before DMA stop for ALPM
remote:
remote:          The AHCI driver code stops and starts port DMA engines at will
remote:          without considering the power state of the particular port. The
remote:          AHCI specification isn't very clear on how to handle this scenario,
remote:          leaving implementation open to interpretation.
remote:
remote:          Broadcom's STB SATA host controller is unable to handle port DMA
remote:          controller restarts when the port in question is in low power mode.
remote:          When a port enters partial or slumber mode, it's PHY is powered down.
remote:          When a controller restart is requested, the controller's internal
remote:          state machine expects the PHY to be brought back up by software which
remote:          never happens in this case, resulting in failures.
remote:
remote:          To avoid this situation, logic is added to manually wake up the port
remote:          just before it's DMA engine is stopped, if the port happens to be in
remote:          a low power state. HBA initiated power management ensures that the port
remote:          eventually returns to it's configured low power state, when the link is
remote:          idle (as per the conditions listed in the spec). A new host flag is also
remote:          added to ensure this logic is only exercised for hosts with the above
remote:          limitation.

remote:          irqchip: bcm7120-l2: Fix interrupt status reads for multiple L1
remote:
remote:          Our irq-bcm7120-l2 interrupt controller driver utilizes the same handler
remote:          function for the different parent interrupts it services: UPG_MAIN, UPG_BSC for
remote:          instance.
remote:
remote:          The problem is that function reads the IRQSTAT register which can combine
remote:          interrupt causes for different parent interrupts, such that we can end-up in the
remote:          following situation:
remote:
remote:          - CPU takes an interrupt
remote:          - bcm7120_l2_intc_irq_handle() reads IRQSTAT
remote:          - generic_handle_irq() is invoked
remote:          - there are still pending interrupts flagged in IRQSTAT from a different parent
remote:          - handle_bad_irq() is invoked
remote:
remote:          In order to fix this, make sure that we always mask IRQSTAT with the
remote:          appropriate bits that correspond go the parent interrupt source this is coming
remote:          from. To simplify things, associate an unique structure per parent interrupt
remote:          handler to avoid multiplying the number of lookups.
remote:
remote:          While at it, remove the unused 'gc' argument from bcm7120_l2_intc_irq_handle().

remote:          irqchip: bcm7120-l2: Eliminate bad IRQ check
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit f668f074ff58dea540d83bbed1b2c1171b0dd764]
remote:
remote:          This check may be prone to race conditions, e.g.
remote:
remote:          1) Some external event (e.g. GPIO level) causes an IRQ to become pending
remote:          2) Peripheral asserts the L2 IRQ
remote:          3) CPU takes an interrupt
remote:          4) The event from #1 goes away
remote:          5) bcm7120_l2_intc_irq_handle() reads back a 0 status
remote:
remote:          Unlike the hardware supported by brcmstb-l2, the bcm7120-l2 controller
remote:          does not latch the IRQ status.  Bits can change if the inputs to the
remote:          controller change.  Also, do_bad_IRQ() is an ARM-specific macro.
remote:
remote:          So let's just nuke it.

remote:          brcmstb: memory: add special vmap() for BMEM
remote:
remote:          vmap(), by default, checks to see that the number of pages is not larger than
remote:          the total number of pages managed by Linux.  Usually, this is a nice sanity
remote:          check, and we want to keep that for any of the kernel's vmap() invocations.
remote:          However, this is a problem for our use case because we actually want to vmap()
remote:          pages that are _not_ managed by Linux.  This essentially copies vmap() but
remote:          removes the check against totalram_pages.

remote:          BCMGENET: Delay PHY initialization to bcmgenet_open()
remote:
remote:          We are currently doing a full PHY initialization and starting the PHY state
remote:          machine during bcmgenet_mii_init() which is executed in the probe function.
remote:          This is convenient to determine whether we can attach to a proper PHY device
remote:          but comes with expense of spending up to 10ms per MDIO transaction, which
remote:          slows things down.
remote:
remote:          This also creates a situation where we end-up attaching twice to the PHY,
remote:          which is not quite correct either.
remote:
remote:          Fix this by moving bcmgenet_mii_probe() into bcmgenet_open().

remote:          BCMGENET: Remove excessive PHY reset
remote:
remote:          We are currently issuing multiple PHY resets during a suspend/resume,
remote:          first during bcmgenet_power_up() which does a hardware reset, then a
remote:          software reset by calling bcmgenet_mii_reset(). This is both unnecessary
remote:          and can take as long as 10ms per MDIO transactions while we re-apply
remote:          workarounds because we do not yet have MDIO interrupts enabled.
remote:
remote:          phy_resume() takes care of re-apply our workarounds in case we need any,
remote:          and bcmgenet_power_up() does a PHY hardware reset, all of this is more
remote:          than enough to guarantee that the PHY operates correctly.

remote:
remote:          When updating the default reservation code to handle reserved-memory[1]
remote:          DT entries in addition to memreserve, I made an off-by-one error when
remote:          checking for the unhandled 'split region' case and could also set the

remote:          mmc: Some Micron eMMC devices cause reboot to hang
remote:
remote:          When using eMMC as the boot device, some Micron eMMC devices will
remote:          cause reboot to hang. This is a result of the eMMC device not going
remote:          into boot mode after the hardware sends CMD0 to reset the eMMC
remote:          device. This only happens if the kernel driver sends CMD5 (SLEEP_WAKE),
remote:          to put the device into sleep state, before restarting the system.
remote:          The fix is to add a quirk that avoids sending the SLEEP command
remote:          and to use MMC_FIXUP to set the quirk for these Micron devices.

remote:          net: phy: mdio-bcm-unimac: workaround initial read failures for integrated PHYs
remote:
remote:          All BCM7xxx integrated Gigabit PHYs have an issue in their MDIO
remote:          management controller which will make the initial read or write to them
remote:          to fail and return 0xffff. This is a real issue as the typical first
remote:          thing we do is read from MII_PHYSID1 and MII_PHYSID2 from get_phy_id()
remote:          to register a driver for these PHYs.
remote:
remote:          Coupled with the workaround in drivers/net/phy/bcm7xxx.c, this
remote:          workaround for the MDIO bus controller consists in scanning the list of
remote:          PHYs to do this initial read workaround for as part of the MDIO bus
remote:          reset routine which is invoked prior to mdiobus_scan().
remote:
remote:          Once we have a proper PHY driver/device registered, all workarounds are
remote:          located there (e.g: power management suspend/resume calls).

remote:
remote:          This reverts commit ced41ec297954d70a43b059bd4f44669e368e1dc. Alex Chu reported
remote:          a noticeable performance drop, ranging from ~940Mbits/sec to ~760Mbits/sec.
remote:
remote:          These changes were tested against an upstream kernel which contains some
remote:          improvements on how SKB allocation in NAPI context operate, and these changes
remote:          are not in 3.14 yet and way too invasive to backport.
remote:
remote:          Revert back to the previous behavior which consists in invalidating data cache
remote:          lines after DMA, processing the packet, and then re-allocating it during the
remote:          refill operation.

remote:          soc: brcmstb: memory: fix up default reserve alignment
remote:
remote:          When moving the default reservation logic, I accidentally left out a
remote:          crucial change for the 512M DRAM case: alignment fixing.  While this
remote:          should _hopefully_ only be required for 512M, we actually want to be
remote:          pageblock-aligned all the time (well, it's not pageblock for transparent
remote:          hugepages, but it's easier to just say pageblock), and it's certainly
remote:          possible that some memory reservations might not be so aligned.  So just
remote:          do the alignment all of the time like we were doing in cma_driver
remote:          before.
remote:
remote:          Tested on 73649a0 (512M RAM) that default boot-time CMA reserve works
remote:          and 'cmatool unittest' passes all tests after this change.

remote:          net: dsa: bcm_sf2: do not use indirect reads and writes for 7445E0
remote:
remote:          7445E0 contains an ECO (HW7445-1526) which disconnected the internal SF2
remote:          pseudo-PHY which was known to conflict with the external pseudo-PHY of
remote:          BCM53125 switches. This motivated the need to utilize the internal SF2
remote:          MDIO controller via indirect register reads/writes to control external
remote:          Broadcom switches due to this address conflict (both responded at
remote:          address 30d).
remote:
remote:          For 7445E0, the internal pseudo-PHY of the SF2 switch got disconnected,
remote:          and as a consequence this prevents the internal SF2 MDIO bus controller
remote:          from reading data (reads back everything as 0) since the MDI line is
remote:          tied low.
remote:
remote:          Fix this by making the indirect register reads and writes conditional to
remote:          7445D0, on 7445E0 we can utilize the SWITCH_MDIO controller (backed by
remote:          mdio-unimac and not the DSA created slave MII bus).

remote:          gpio: brcmstb: support wakeup from S5 cold boot
remote:
remote:          For wake from S5, we need to:
remote:          - register a reboot handler
remote:          - set wakeup capability before requesting IRQ so wakeup count is incremented
remote:          - mask all GPIO IRQs and clear any pending interrupts during driver probe to
remote:            since no driver will yet be registered to handle any IRQs carried over from
remote:            boot at that time, and it's possible that the booted kernel does not request
remote:            the same IRQ anyway.
remote:
remote:          This means that /sys/.../power/wakeup_count is valid at boot time,
remote:          and we can properly account for S5 wakeup stats. e.g.:
remote:
remote:            ### After waking from S5 from a GPIO key
remote:            # cat /sys/bus/platform/drivers/brcmstb-gpio/f04172c0.gpio/power/wakeup

remote:          gpio: brcmstb: switch to using gpiolib irqchip helpers
remote:
remote:          Switches the BRCMSTB UPG GIO driver to using the gpiolib irqchip helpers
remote:          in the gpiolib core.  This lets us reduce the amount of duplicated code
remote:          a bit.  For this to work, the irq setup function is changed to be called
remote:          once per bank instead of once per device.
remote:
remote:          What wasn't obvious to me before: you can have multiple chained irqchips
remote:          and associated IRQ domains for a single parent IRQ, and as long as the
remote:          xlate function is written correctly, a GPIO IRQ request end up checking
remote:          the correct domain and will get associated with the correct IRQ.  What
remote:          helps make this clear is to read
remote:            drivers/gpio/gpiolib-of.c:
remote:             - of_gpiochip_find_and_xlate()
remote:             - of_get_named_gpiod_flags()
remote:            drivers/gpio/gpiolib.c:
remote:             - gpiochip_find()

remote:          after allocating the priv struct to both avoid the null pointer dereference
remote:          that could occur today.  To guard against potential future changes, check for

remote:          gpio: support threaded interrupts in irqchip helpers
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 1c8732bb0355b929b09173464cdca7df4d516f89]
remote:
remote:          Some off-chip GPIO expanders need to be communicated by I2C or
remote:          SPI traffic, but may still support IRQs. By the sleeping nature
remote:          of such buses, such IRQ handlers need to be threaded. Support
remote:          such handlers in the gpiochip irqchip helpers by flagging IRQs
remote:          as threaded if the .can_sleep property of the gpiochip is
remote:          true.
remote:
remote:          Helpfully deny registration of chained IRQ handlers if the
remote:          .can_sleep property is set, as such chips will invariably need
remote:          a nested handler rather than a chained handler.

remote:          gpio: add IRQ chip helpers in gpiolib
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 1425052097b53de841e064dc190a9009480c208c]
remote:
remote:          This provides a function gpiochip_irqchip_add() to set
remote:          up an irqchip for a GPIO controller, and a function
remote:          gpiochip_set_chained_irqchip() to chain it to a parent
remote:          irqchip.
remote:
remote:          Most GPIOs are of the type where a number of lines form
remote:          a cascaded interrupt controller chained onto
remote:          the primary system interrupt controller (or further down the
remote:          chain) so let's add this helper and factor the code to
remote:          request the lines to be used as IRQs, the .to_irq() function
remote:          and the irqdomain into the core as well.

remote:          genirq: Provide irq_request/release_resources chip callbacks
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit f438acdf3de8f19ad2789eddbf52e3280292759b]
remote:
remote:          For certain irq types, e.g. gpios, it's necessary to request resources
remote:          before starting up the irq.
remote:
remote:          This might fail so we cannot use the irq_startup() callback because we
remote:          might call the irq_set_type() callback before that which does not make
remote:          sense when the resource is not available. Calling irq_startup() before
remote:          irq_set_type() can lead to spurious interrupts which is not desired
remote:          either.

remote:          gpiolib: Allow GPIO chips to request their own GPIOs
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 77c2d7929d7d7f0e391b17f85d2d954912ed0590]
remote:
remote:          Sometimes it is useful to allow GPIO chips themselves to request GPIOs they
remote:          own through gpiolib API. One use case is ACPI ASL code that should be able
remote:          to toggle GPIOs through GPIO operation regions.
remote:
remote:          We can't use gpio_request() because it will pin the module to the kernel
remote:          forever (it calls try_module_get()). To solve this we move module refcount
remote:          manipulation to gpiod_request() and let __gpiod_request() handle the actual
remote:          request. This changes the sequence a bit as now try_module_get() is called
remote:          outside of gpio_lock (I think this is safe, try_module_get() handles
remote:          serialization it needs already).
remote:
remote:          Then we provide gpiolib internal functions gpiochip_request/free_own_desc()
remote:          that do the same as gpio_request() but don't manipulate module refrence
remote:          count. This allows the GPIO chip driver to request and free descriptors it
remote:          owns without being pinned to the kernel forever.

remote:          gpiolib: add gpiochip_get_desc() driver function
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit bb1e88ccb771492ac908ac295ec135efa1d53093]
remote:
remote:          Some drivers dealing with a gpio_chip might need to act on its
remote:          descriptors directly; one example is pinctrl drivers that need to lock a
remote:          GPIO for being used as IRQ using gpiod_lock_as_irq().
remote:
remote:          This patch exports a gpiochip_get_desc() function that returns the
remote:          GPIO descriptor at the requested index. It also sweeps the
remote:          gpio_to_chip() function out of the consumer interface since any holder
remote:          of a gpio_chip reference can manipulate its GPIOs way beyond what a
remote:          consumer should be allowed to do.
remote:
remote:          As a result, gpio_chip is not visible anymore to simple GPIO consumers.

remote:          soc: brcmstb: Add memory API for middleware
remote:
remote:          Adds a way for the Broadcom middleware (nexus) to be able to get the
remote:          information it needs about how memory is placed on the system.  This is done by
remote:          the ability to populate a struct brcmstb_memory with info on
remote:          - PA ranges for each memory controller
remote:          - static "bmem" ranges
remote:          - dynamic (CMA in this case) reserved ranges
remote:          - reserved areas unavailable to middleware
remote:
remote:          We use libfdt to read the device tree for info on what memory should actually
remote:          be visible.
remote:
remote:          Moves phys_addr_to_memc from cma_driver to memory API and renames as
remote:          brcmstb_memory_phys_addr_to_memc, since it is now shared by cma_driver and this
remote:          code.
remote:
remote:          This also adds to the platform reserve code in order to grab the memblock
remote:          reserve info during early boot, as the memblock info isn't discarded later.

remote:          brcmstb: port bmem from stblinux-3.3-3.5 release
remote:
remote:          Changes include:
remote:
remote:          - Place in drivers/soc/brcmstb
remote:          - Use new Kconfig entry to enable: CONFIG_BRCMSTB_BMEM
remote:          - No default allocation (must specify everything manually).
remote:          - Does not assume that address 0 means "put at end of memc0".  It'll put the
remote:            reserved regions wherever you want.
remote:          - No safeties: you can reserve all of lowmem if you want to watch the kernel
remote:            crash and burn.
remote:          - No special handling for memc1: not needed since we're not overriding the
remote:            default free_bootmem like on mips, but rather providing a saner means via
remote:            bmem_reserve which uses memblock and will be called from arch code.
remote:          - MAX_BMEM_REGIONS bumped from 4 to 8.
remote:          - Uses phys_addr_t instead of unsigned long so we can use >32-bit addresses
remote:            where appropriate.
remote:          - Don't BUG on pud_none in bmem_get_page because we've seen this unnecessarily
remote:            crashes the kernel on ARM when called from GUP (see SWLINUX-3350)
remote:          - Use phys_addr_t for bmem functions

remote:
remote:          Commit 60b4ea1781fd ("net: systemport: log RX buffer allocation and RX/TX DMA
remote:          failures") added a few software maintained statistics using
remote:          BCM_SYSPORT_STAT_MIB_RX and BCM_SYSPORT_STAT_MIB_TX. These statistics are read
remote:          from the hardware MIB counters, such that bcm_sysport_update_mib_counters() was
remote:          trying to read from a non-existing MIB offset for these counters.
remote:
remote:          Fix this by introducing a special type: BCM_SYSPORT_STAT_SOFT, similar to
remote:          BCM_SYSPORT_STAT_NETDEV, such that bcm_sysport_get_ethtool_stats will read from

remote:          BCMSYSPORT: rewrite bcm_sysport_rx_refill
remote:
remote:          Currently, bcm_sysport_desc_rx() calls bcm_sysport_rx_refill() at the end of Rx
remote:          packet processing loop, after the current Rx packet has already been passed to
remote:          napi_gro_receive(). However, bcm_sysport_rx_refill() might fail to allocate a new
remote:          Rx skb, thus leaving a hole on the Rx queue where no valid Rx buffer exists.
remote:
remote:          To eliminate this situation:
remote:
remote:          1. Rewrite bcm_sysport_rx_refill() to retain the current Rx skb on the
remote:          Rx queue if a new replacement Rx skb can't be allocated and DMA-mapped.
remote:          In this case, the data on the current Rx skb is effectively dropped.
remote:
remote:          2. Modify bcm_sysport_desc_rx() to call bcm_sysport_rx_refill() at the
remote:          top of Rx packet processing loop, so that the new replacement Rx skb is
remote:          already in place before the current Rx skb is processed.
remote:
remote:          This is loosely inspired from d6707bec5986 ("net: bcmgenet: rewrite
remote:          bcmgenet_rx_refill()")

remote:          Out of the brcmstb SoCs that I know, BCM3390 has the largest numbers of GPIOs,

remote:          - 2*32 = 64 UPG AON GPIOs (counting unused lines)
remote:          Total: 544
remote:
remote:          I suspect that the upper limit will only need to be higher in the future, so

remote:          gpio: brcmstb: Allow GPIOs to be wakeup sources
remote:
remote:          Several drivers (e.g. gpio-keys) allow for GPIOs to be configured as wakeup
remote:          sources, and this GPIO controller supports that through a separate interrupt
remote:          path.
remote:
remote:          The de-facto standard DT property "wakeup-source" is checked, since that
remote:          indicates whether the GPIO controller hardware can wake.  Uses the
remote:          IRQCHIP_MASK_ON_SUSPEND irq_chip flag because UPG GIO doesn't have any of its

remote:          gpio: clamp returned values to the boolean range
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 23600969ff137cf4c3bc9098f77e381de334e3f7]
remote:
remote:          Nothing prevents GPIO drivers from returning values outside the
remote:          boolean range, and as it turns out a few drivers are actually doing so.
remote:          These values were passed as-is to unsuspecting consumers and created
remote:          confusion.
remote:
remote:          This patch makes the internal _gpiod_get_raw_value() function return a
remote:          bool, effectively clamping the GPIO value to the boolean range no
remote:          matter what the driver does.
remote:
remote:          While we are at it, we also change the value parameter of
remote:          _gpiod_set_raw_value() to bool type before drivers start doing funny
remote:          things with it as well.
remote:
remote:          Another way to fix this would be to change the prototypes of the driver
remote:          interface to use bool directly, but this would require a huge
remote:          cross-systems patch so this simpler solution is preferred.
remote:
remote:          Changes since v1:
remote:          - Change local variable type to bool as well, use boolean values in
remote:            code
remote:          - Also change prototype of open drain/open source setting functions
remote:            since they are only called from _gpiod_set_raw_value()
remote:
remote:          This probably calls for a larger booleanization of gpiolib, but let's
remote:          keep that for a latter change - right now we need to address the issue
remote:          of non-boolean values returned by drivers.

remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit ef70bbe1aaa612f75360e5df5952fddec50b7ca9]
remote:
remote:          The documentation was not clear about whether
remote:          gpio_direction_output should take a logical value or the physical
remote:          level on the output line, i.e. whether the ACTIVE_LOW status
remote:          would be taken into account.
remote:
remote:          This converts gpiod_direction_output to use the logical level
remote:          and adds a new gpiod_direction_output_raw for the raw value.

remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 3be2a49e5c08d268f8af0dd4fe89a24ea8cdc339]
remote:
remote:          Some Ethernet MACs have a "fixed link", and are not connected to a
remote:          normal MDIO-managed PHY device. For those situations, a Device Tree
remote:          binding allows to describe a "fixed link" using a special PHY node.
remote:
remote:          This patch adds:
remote:
remote:           * A documentation for the fixed PHY Device Tree binding.
remote:
remote:           * An of_phy_is_fixed_link() function that an Ethernet driver can call
remote:             on its PHY phandle to find out whether it's a fixed link PHY or
remote:             not. It should typically be used to know if
remote:             of_phy_register_fixed_link() should be called.
remote:
remote:           * An of_phy_register_fixed_link() function that instantiates the
remote:             fixed PHY into the PHY subsystem, so that when the driver calls
remote:             of_phy_connect(), the PHY device associated to the OF node will be
remote:             found.
remote:
remote:          These two additional functions also support the old fixed-link Device
remote:          Tree binding used on PowerPC platforms, so that ultimately, the
remote:          network device drivers for those platforms could be converted to use
remote:          of_phy_is_fixed_link() and of_phy_register_fixed_link() instead of
remote:          of_phy_connect_fixed_link(), while keeping compatibility with their
remote:          respective Device Tree bindings.

remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit a75951217472c522c324adb0a4de3ba69d656ef5]
remote:
remote:          The existing fixed_phy_add() function has several drawbacks that
remote:          prevents it from being used as is for OF-based declaration of fixed
remote:          PHYs:
remote:
remote:           * The address of the PHY on the fake bus needs to be passed, while a
remote:             dynamic allocation is desired.
remote:
remote:           * Since the phy_device instantiation is post-poned until the next
remote:             mdiobus scan, there is no way to associate the fixed PHY with its
remote:             OF node, which later prevents of_phy_connect() from finding this
remote:             fixed PHY from a given OF node.
remote:
remote:          To solve this, this commit introduces fixed_phy_register(), which will
remote:          allocate an available PHY address, add the PHY using fixed_phy_add()
remote:          and instantiate the phy_device structure associated with the provided
remote:          OF node.

remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 9b744942290c168287013f0a19ff7392f65c8107]
remote:
remote:          Until now, the fixed_phy_add() function was taking as argument
remote:          'phy_id', which was used both as the PHY address on the fake fixed
remote:          MDIO bus, and as the PHY id, as available in the MII_PHYSID1 and
remote:          MII_PHYSID2 registers. However, those two informations are completely
remote:          unrelated.
remote:
remote:          This patch decouples them. The PHY id of fixed PHYs is hardcoded to be
remote:          0x0. Ideally, a really reserved value would be nicer, but there
remote:          doesn't seem to be an easy of making sure a dummy value can be
remote:          assigned to the Linux kernel for such usage.
remote:
remote:          The PHY address remains passed by the caller of phy_fixed_add().

remote:          net: dsa: bcm_sf2: propagate carrier down states
remote:
remote:          There is currently a complex race condition with fixed PHYs utilizing a
remote:          link_update callback in how they propagate link down notifications. We may, or
remote:          may not, under certain circumstances reach the PHY_NOLINK state in the PHY state
remote:          machine, which means that we will never call netif_carrier_off() for that
remote:          interface. This is a problem for link monitoring applications since they will
remote:          never learn about the "NO-CARRIER" flag.
remote:
remote:          Fix that by explicitly calling netif_carrier_off() in our link_update callback
remote:          to propagate carrier state changes accordingly.

remote:          gpio: Add GPIO support for Broadcom STB SoCs
remote:
remote:          This adds support for the GPIO IP "UPG GIO" used on Broadcom STB SoCs
remote:          (BCM7XXX and some others).  Uses basic_mmio_gpio to instantiate a
remote:          gpio_chip for each bank.  The driver assumes that it handles the base
remote:          set of GPIOs on the system and that it can start its numbering sequence
remote:          from 0, so any GPIO expanders used with it must dynamically assign GPIO
remote:          numbers after this driver has finished registering its GPIOs.
remote:
remote:          Does not implement the interrupt-controller portion yet, will be done in a
remote:          future commit.

remote:          thermal: brcmstb_thermal: add of-thermal and hardware trigger support
remote:
remote:          We can make use of the upstream thermal device tree bindings to
remote:          configure trip points for us. We can also make use of the proposed
remote:          .set_trips() callback, which was backported in a previous patch (not
remote:          upstream yet) to utilize our high/low interrupts most economically.
remote:
remote:          Because we supplied some basic support for temperature readins
remote:          previously, where this driver registered its own standalone thermal zone
remote:          (without using the of-thermal framework), I have migrated the existing
remote:          support into a fall-back 'brcmstb_thermal_zone_probe()' option. This
remote:          can help transition between device trees that have the 'thermal-zones'
remote:          node set up and those that don't. We should schedule this to be removed
remote:          quickly in a future release.

remote:          thermal: user_space: add trip point number and temperature to uevent data
remote:
remote:          Now that the thermal core supplies trip notifications when
remote:          *crossing* a trip point, and only for that single trip point, it is
remote:          useful to provide this information in the uevent metadata. That way, a
remote:          user-space governor can figure out this information directly, without
remote:          any guessing. This also eliminates a potential race, where the
remote:          temperature may have changed between the time a hardware trip was fired
remote:          and the time it is received by the governor.
remote:
remote:          This patch should be submitted upstream. It's possible this will not
remote:          suit the general needs of other thermal users, and so we might consider
remote:          integrating this directly into brcmstb_thermal instead.

remote:          thermal: report trips only when crossed
remote:
remote:          For some reason, the existing infrastructure will notify *all* trip
remote:          points whenever any driver calls thermal_zone_device_update_temp(). This
remote:          is unfortunate for users of hardware-backed trip points, since that
remote:          means we lose all information about which trip point triggered the
remote:          update, if any.
remote:
remote:          Instead, let's only call handle_thermal_trip() when we've crossed a
remote:          trip.
remote:
remote:          This should be submitted upstream, possibly with some rework to make it
remote:          more generically useful. If nothing else, it might generate some
remote:          explanation as to why the trip point notifications are currently so
remote:          peculiar, as described above.

remote:          thermal: add thermal_zone_device_update_temp() API
remote:
remote:          Allow drivers to report a particular update temperature.
remote:
remote:          This is important for hardware-supported trip points. On such hardware,
remote:          there is a potential for inconstency in the following sequence:
remote:
remote:          (1) hardware interrupt
remote:          (2) themal_zone_device_update(),
remote:          (3) zone->get_temp()
remote:
remote:          Between (1) and (3), the temperature might change a bit.
remote:
remote:          So, rather than add in caching to the sensor driver to record the
remote:          temperature at (1), just allow the driver to pass it directly through.

remote:          thermal: Add support for hardware-tracked trip points
remote:
remote:          [Backported preliminary patch. See thread:
remote:          http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.power-management.general/58483/]
remote:
remote:          This adds support for hardware-tracked trip points to the device tree
remote:          thermal sensor framework.
remote:
remote:          The framework supports an arbitrary number of trip points. Whenever
remote:          the current temperature is updated, the trip points immediately
remote:          below and above the current temperature are found. A .set_trips
remote:          callback is then called with the temperatures. If there is no trip
remote:          point above or below the current temperature, the passed trip
remote:          temperature will be ULONG_MAX or 0 respectively. In this callback,
remote:          the driver should program the hardware such that it is notified
remote:          when either of these trip points are triggered. When a trip point
remote:          is triggered, the driver should call `thermal_zone_device_update'
remote:          for the respective thermal zone. This will cause the trip points
remote:          to be updated again.
remote:
remote:          If .set_trips is not implemented, the framework behaves as before.
remote:
remote:          This patch is based on an earlier version from Mikko Perttunen

remote:          thermal: Allow sensor ops to fail with -ENOSYS
remote:
remote:          [Backported preliminary patch. See thread:
remote:          http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.power-management.general/58483/]
remote:
remote:          The thermal core uses the existence of the .get_temp, .get_trend and
remote:          .set_emul_temp to detect whether this operation exists and should be
remote:          used or whether it should be emulated in software. This makes problems
remote:          for of-thermal which has to modify the struct thermal_zone_device_ops
remote:          during runtime whenever a sensor is registered or unregistered.
remote:
remote:          Let the core test for -ENOSYS from these callbacks and treat it like
remote:          if the callbacks were not present.
remote:
remote:          This allows of-thermal to always set the sensor related callbacks and
remote:          to make struct thermal_zone_device_ops const again.

remote:
remote:          [Backported preliminary patch. See thread:

remote:
remote:          The .get_trend callback in struct thermal_zone_device_ops has the prototype:
remote:
remote:          	int (*get_trend) (struct thermal_zone_device *, int,
remote:          			  enum thermal_trend *);

remote:
remote:          Streamline both prototypes and add the trip argument to the OF callback
remote:          aswell and use enum thermal_trend * instead of an integer pointer.
remote:
remote:          While the OF prototype may be the better one, this should be decided at

remote:          thermal: Fix not emulating critical temperatures
remote:
remote:          [Backported preliminary patch. See thread:
remote:          http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.power-management.general/58483/]
remote:
remote:          commit e6e238c38 (thermal: sysfs: Add a new sysfs node emul_temp for
remote:          thermal emulation)  promised not to emulate critical temperatures,
remote:          but the check for critical temperatures is broken in multiple ways:
remote:
remote:          - The code should only accept an emulated temperature when the emulated
remote:            temperature is lower than the critical temperature. Instead the code
remote:            accepts an emulated temperature whenever the real temperature is lower
remote:            than the critical temperature. This makes no sense and trying to
remote:            emulate a temperature higher than the critical temperature halts the
remote:            system.
remote:          - When trying to emulate a higher-than-critical temperature we should either
remote:            limit the emulated temperature to the maximum non critical temperature
remote:            or refuse to emulate this temperature. Instead the code just silently
remote:            ignores the emulated temperature and continues with the real temperature.
remote:
remote:          This patch moves the test for illegal emulated temperature to the sysfs
remote:          write function so that we can properly refuse illegal temperatures here.
remote:          Trying to write illegal temperatures results in an error message. While
remote:          at it use IS_ENABLED() instead of #ifdefs.

remote:          thermal: Fix cdev registration with THERMAL_NO_LIMIT on 64bit
remote:
remote:          The size of unsigned long varies between 32 and 64 bit systems while
remote:          the size of phandle arguments is always 32 bits per parameter.
remote:
remote:          On 64-bit systems, cooling devices registered via of-thermal apis fail
remote:          to bind when the min/max cooling state is specified as
remote:          THERMAL_NO_LIMIT (-1UL) as there is a mis-match between the value read
remote:          from the device tree (32bit) and the pre-processor define (64bit).
remote:
remote:          As we're unlikely to need cooling states larger than 32 bits, and for
remote:          consistency with the size of phandle arguments, explicitly limit
remote:          THERMAL_NO_LIMIT to 32 bits.

remote:          thermal: of: improve of-thermal sensor registration API
remote:
remote:          Different drivers request API extensions in of-thermal. For this reason,
remote:          additional callbacks are required to fit the new drivers needs.
remote:
remote:          The current API implementation expects the registering sensor driver
remote:          to provide a get_temp and get_trend callbacks as function parameters.
remote:          As the amount of callbacks is growing, this patch changes the existing
remote:          implementation to use a .ops field to hold all the of thermal callbacks
remote:          to sensor drivers.
remote:
remote:          This patch also changes the existing of-thermal users to fit the new
remote:          API design. No functional change is introduced in this patch.

remote:          thermal: step_wise: fix: Prevent from binary overflow when trend is dropping
remote:
remote:          It turns out that some boards can have instance->lower greater than 0 and
remote:          when thermal trend is dropping it results with next_target equal to -1.
remote:
remote:          Since the next_target is defined as unsigned long it is interpreted as
remote:          0xFFFFFFFF and larger than instance->upper.
remote:          As a result the next_target is set to instance->upper which ramps up to
remote:          maximal cooling device target when the temperature is steadily decreasing.

remote:          thermal: add support to disable thermal zone from DTS
remote:
remote:          Add support to check status of the thermal zone before registering the
remote:          zone. This will help on disabling some non-existing thermal zone from
remote:          the top level DTS file out of common dtsi thermalzone file.
remote:
remote:          For example,
remote:          we have 3 platforms almost same but thermal zones on this platform are
remote:          little bit different. Platform 1 and 2 have three thermal zones and
remote:          platform 3 has two thermal zones. To avoid duplication of the thermal
remote:          zones entries on each DTS file of platforms,we created one common
remote:          dtsi file for thermal zone and included this dtsi file from these
remote:          3 platform's top level dts file.
remote:
remote:          On common thermal zone com dtsi file, all thermal zone are enabled and
remote:          need to disable one of thermal zone on platform 3 dts file. For this, we
remote:          just added entry status = "disabled" for that thermal zone on platform 3
remote:          dts file and along with this change to make it work.
remote:
remote:          This way, we reuse the common file and control the enable/disable of the
remote:          thermal zone from top level dts file.

remote:          clk: divider: handle integer overflow when dividing large clock rates
remote:
remote:          [Backported version of patch from:
remote:          http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.power-management.general/59004
remote:          Some discussion at:
remote:          lkml.kernel.org/g/20150413201433.GQ32500@ld-irv-0074]
remote:
remote:          On 32-bit architectures, 'unsigned long' (the type used to hold clock
remote:          rates, in Hz) is often only 32 bits wide. DIV_ROUND_UP() (as used in,
remote:          e.g., commit b11d282dbea2 "clk: divider: fix rate calculation for
remote:          fractional rates") can yield an integer overflow on clock rates that are
remote:          not (by themselves) too large to fit in 32 bits, because it performs
remote:          addition before the division. See for example:
remote:
remote:            DIV_ROUND_UP(3000000000, 1500000000) = (3.0G + 1.5G - 1) / 1.5G
remote:                                                 = OVERFLOW / 1.5G
remote:
remote:          This patch fixes such cases by always promoting the dividend to 64-bits
remote:          (unsigned long long) before doing the division. While this patch does
remote:          not resolve the issue with large clock rates across the common clock
remote:          framework nor address the problems with doing full 64-bit arithmetic on
remote:          a 32-bit architecture, it does fix some issues seen when using clock
remote:          dividers on a 3GHz reference clock to produce a 1.5GHz CPU clock for an
remote:          ARMv7 Brahma B15 SoC.

remote:          clk: clk-divider: pass width to _register_divider()
remote:
remote:          _register_divider() expects a mask width parameter, not the mask itself.
remote:
remote:          Also add extra sanity checking on the device tree, since we really
remote:          expect a contiguous mask, packed to the low bit position.
remote:
remote:          Note that the code in question has not been merged upstream; the
remote:          original code was just grabbed off the mailing list.
remote:
remote:          Perhaps for an upstream submission, this property should be reworked as
remote:          a 'mask-width' parameter instead? It's not clear to me what we would do
remote:          with a non-contiguous mask, as this binding (and driver) was not really
remote:          designed for it. And I don't think such hardware exists, at least not in

remote:          ARM: Introduce CPU_METHOD_OF_DECLARE() for cpu hotplug/smp
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 6c3ff8b11a16ec69199ab85b74a5fae6d9c59db7]
remote:
remote:          The goal of multi-platform kernels is to remove the need for mach
remote:          directories and machine descriptors. To further that goal,
remote:          introduce CPU_METHOD_OF_DECLARE() to allow cpu hotplug/smp
remote:          support to be separated from the machine descriptors.
remote:          Implementers should specify an enable-method property in their
remote:          cpus node and then implement a matching set of smp_ops in their
remote:          hotplug/smp code, wiring it up with the CPU_METHOD_OF_DECLARE()
remote:          macro. When the kernel is compiled we'll collect all the
remote:          enable-method smp_ops into one section for use at boot.
remote:
remote:          At boot time we'll look for an enable-method in each cpu node and
remote:          try to match that against all known CPU enable methods in the
remote:          kernel. If there are no enable-methods in the cpu nodes we
remote:          fallback to the cpus node and try to use any enable-method found
remote:          there. If that doesn't work we fall back to the old way of using
remote:          the machine descriptor.

remote:          bsp: Use brcm,write-pairing from DT to enable MCP write-pairing
remote:
remote:          If we can find a "brcm,write-pairing" boolean property in Device Tree, enable
remote:          MCP write-pairing. disable_mcp_write_pairing() is renamed to
remote:          mcp_write_pairing_set() to illustrate that it can both enable or disable.
remote:
remote:          For Device Tree that do not have this property, the behavior is unchanged, and
remote:          we keep disabling MCP write-pairing.
remote:
remote:          Newer chips which have working MCP write-pairing are expected to place this
remote:          property in the hif_cpubiuctrl node to indicate this.

remote:          kconfig: Print full defined and depends for multiply-defined symbols
remote:
remote:          [Upstream submission: https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/4/8/754 ]
remote:
remote:          get_symbol_str() was assuming that symbols would only have a single

remote:          This is not true, and one current example is FRAME_POINTER which is
remote:          both in lib/Kconfig.debug and arch/arm/Kconfig.debug.
remote:
remote:          In order to print out the correct Defined and Depends info, iterate
remote:          over all properties associated with the given symbol, similarly to was
remote:          done for selects.  And for depends, rather than iterating over the

remote:          cma: brcm-cma: do not use first meminfo bank if >1 bank

remote:          ARM: mmu: Bump default vmalloc to 744 MiB for BRCMSTB with >=1 GiB RAM
remote:
remote:          If >= 1 GiB RAM is present (or more than one meminfo bank exists), this
remote:          increases the vmalloc area to 744 MiB and thus reduces the default amount of
remote:          lowmem to 256 MiB, which is basically all we were getting anyway with
remote:          cma_driver putting all other memory in CMA regions.  This should eliminate what
remote:          has been referred to as the "CMA barrier" (the split in memory regions on the
remote:          first memory controller because of the lowmem/highmem boundary) without
remote:          negatively impacting the actual amount of memory on the system (kernel
remote:          allocations mostly couldn't use lowmem in CMA regions anyway).
remote:
remote:          It'd be nice if we could just have more lowmem so as not to help alleviate
remote:          lowmem exhaustion, but that's a problem for another day.
remote:
remote:          For systems with < 1GB RAM, there was no CMA barrier, so we keep the default
remote:          vmalloc size the same.
remote:
remote:          This will probably need updating if there are ever any boards with 768 MiB RAM.
remote:          Also, the function relies on meminfo so will need to be updated for 3.16+, which
remote:          no longer uses meminfo.

remote:
remote:          Commit f1bee783dd37 moved the call to hook_fault_code in

remote:          this one must also be annotated with __init.
remote:
remote:          In order to avoid introducing another section mismatch, call
remote:          platform_driver_probe() manually and remove the .probe assignment from
remote:          brcmstb_gisb_arb_driver, this is very similar to what

remote:
remote:          Before we kept a statically array of two PCIe structures which
remote:          seemed enough at the time.  With this commit we keep the array,
remote:          but make it an array of pointers that will contain dynmically
remote:          allocated PCIe structures.  In a future commit we will dispose
remote:          of the array entirely and use a list.
remote:
remote:          In the process of making this change, we initialize the
remote:          hw_data.private_data structure so that it points to an array
remote:          of our PCIe pointers.  As such, we can use the pci_sys_data
remote:          structure to recover the PCIe pointer of interest.  This
remote:          obsoletes the awkward bus range counting that was done for
remote:          each RC.

remote:          BCMGENET: power down and up GPHY during suspend if unused
remote:
remote:          In case the interface is not used, power down the integrated GPHY during
remote:          suspend. Similarly to bcmgenet_open(), bcmgenet_resume() powers on the GPHY
remote:          prior to any UniMAC activity.

remote:          net: phy: avoid suspending twice a PHY
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 803dd9c77ac3a08958535f2a1ad5890104e2c235]
remote:
remote:          As part of a call to ndo_close() a netdevice driver may call
remote:          phy_disconnect() -> phy_detach() -> phy_suspend(), such that the PHY is
remote:          suspsended at this point and a netdevice driver may clock gate the
remote:          backing peripheral providing MDIO bus accessses as well.
remote:
remote:          Update mdio_bus_phy_may_suspend() to return whether a PHY is allowed to
remote:          be suspended and conversely resumed if and only if it was not previously
remote:          suspended before while it is currently in detached (netdev pointer is
remote:          NULL) state.
remote:
remote:          This fixes bus errors seen during S2/S3 suspend/resume cycles for
remote:          netdevice drivers such as GENET which clock gates the entire Ethernet
remote:          MAC, including the MDIO bus block.

remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 8a477a6fb6a33651adda772360b85fd813569743]
remote:
remote:          In order to avoid double calls to phydev->drv->suspend and resume, keep
remote:          track of whether the PHY has already been suspended as a consequence of
remote:          a successful call to phy_suspend(). We will use this in our MDIO bus
remote:          suspend/resume hooks to avoid a double suspend call.

remote:          PM / sleep: add configurable delay for pm_test
remote:
remote:          [Queued upstream]
remote:
remote:          When CONFIG_PM_DEBUG=y, we provide a sysfs file (/sys/power/pm_test) for
remote:          selecting one of a few suspend test modes, where rather than entering a
remote:          full suspend state, the kernel will perform some subset of suspend
remote:          steps, wait 5 seconds, and then resume back to normal operation.
remote:
remote:          This mode is useful for (among other things) observing the state of the
remote:          system just before entering a sleep mode, for debugging or analysis
remote:          purposes. However, a constant 5 second wait is not sufficient for some
remote:          sorts of analysis; for example, on an SoC, one might want to use
remote:          external tools to probe the power states of various on-chip controllers
remote:          or clocks.
remote:
remote:          This patch turns this 5 second delay into a configurable module
remote:          parameter, so users can determine how long to wait in this
remote:          pseudo-suspend state before resuming the system.
remote:
remote:          Example (wait 30 seconds);
remote:
remote:            # echo 30 > /sys/module/suspend/parameters/pm_test_delay
remote:            # echo core > /sys/power/pm_test
remote:            # time echo mem  > /sys/power/state
remote:            ...

remote:          spi-brcmstb: Fix BUG() when crossing 4MB boundaries
remote:
remote:          On BSPI <= V3 controllers, the hardware remaps the address bits in a way
remote:          that can cause trouble for transfers that cross a 4MB boundary.  For such
remote:          transfers, we currently BUG() out.  Change the driver behavior so that it
remote:          falls back gracefully to MSPI instead.
remote:
remote:          On BSPI >= V4 controllers, the hardware allows us to disable the remapping
remote:          logic.  So disable remapping during initialization, and disable the driver
remote:          code that modified and checked the address.

remote:

remote:          RM: Add Broadcom Brahma-B15 readahead cache support
remote:
remote:          This patch adds support for the Broadcom Brahma-B15 CPU readahead cache
remote:          controller. This cache controller sits between the L2 and the memory bus
remote:          and its purpose is to provide a friendler burst size towards the DDR
remote:          interface than the native cache line size.
remote:
remote:          The readahead cache is mostly transparent, except for
remote:          flush_kern_cache_all, flush_kern_cache_louis and flush_icache_all, which
remote:          is precisely what we are overriding here.
remote:
remote:          The readahead cache only intercepts reads, not writes, as such, some
remote:          data can remain stale in any of its buffers, such that we need to flush
remote:          it, which is an operation that needs to happen in a particular order:
remote:
remote:          - disable the readahead cache
remote:          - flush it
remote:          - call the appropriate cache-v7.S function
remote:          - re-enable
remote:
remote:          This patch tries to minimize the impact to the cache-v7.S file by only
remote:          providing a stub in case CONFIG_CACHE_B15_RAC is enabled (default for
remote:          ARCH_BRCMSTB since it is the current user).

remote:          PM: hack around a BSP race condition
remote:
remote:          Changes to the PM code have uncovered that if the host is too fast at
remote:          submitting BSP commands (e.g., clock stop and gen_random_key), the BSP
remote:          might not ever respond properly, causing a timeout.
remote:
remote:          According to the BSP firmware team, a few milliseconds (~2-3) wait after
remote:          the clock stop command should be sufficient to fend of such races within
remote:          the BSP. Let's add the hack.

remote:          net: dsa: bcm_sf2: add hardware bridging support
remote:
remote:          Implement the bridge join, leave and set_stp callbacks by making that we
remote:          do the following:
remote:
remote:          - when a port joins the bridge, all existing ports in the bridge get
remote:            their VLAN control register updated with that joining port
remote:          - the joining port is including all existing bridge ports in its own
remote:            VLAN control register
remote:
remote:          The leave operation is fairly similar, special care must be taken to
remote:          make sure that port leaving the bridging is not removing itself from its
remote:          own VLAN control register.
remote:
remote:          Since the various BR_* states apply directly to our HW semantics, we just
remote:          need to translate these constants into their corresponding HW settings,
remote:          and voila!
remote:
remote:          We make sure to trigger a fast-ageing process for ports that are
remote:          joining/leaving the bridge and transition from incompatible states, this
remote:          is equivalent to triggering an ARL flush for that port.

remote:
remote:          Reading 64-bits register was not working because we inverted the steps
remote:          between reading the lower 32-bits of the register and reading the upper
remote:          32-bits. Swapping these operations is how the HW guarantees that 64-bits
remote:          reads are latched correctly. We only have a handful of 64-bits registers
remote:          for now, mostly MIB counters, so the impact is low.

remote:          net: dsa: allow switch drivers to implement bridge ndo operations
remote:
remote:          Allows switch drivers to implement ndo_br_join, ndo_br_leave and
remote:          ndo_br_set_state network device operations and have those be propagated
remote:          down to the switch driver.
remote:
remote:          DSA will resolve which switch ports are currently bridge port members as
remote:          some Switch hardware/drivers need to know about that to limit the
remote:          register programming to just the relevant registers (especially for slow
remote:          MDIO buses).
remote:
remote:          We also take care of setting the correct STP state when slave network
remote:          devices are brought up/down while being bridge members.
remote:
remote:          Finally, when a port is leaving the bridge, we make sure we set in
remote:          BR_STATE_FORWARDING state, otherwise the bridge layer would leave it
remote:          disabled as a result of having left the bridge.

remote:          Currently, in a CMA enabled system, if somebody wants to know the total
remote:          CMA size declared, there is no way to tell, other than the dmesg or
remote:          /var/log/messages logs.
remote:
remote:          With this patch we are showing the CMA info as part of meminfo, so that it
remote:          can be determined at any point of time.  This will be populated only when
remote:          CMA is enabled.

remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit e48322abb061d75096fe52d71886b237e7ae7bfb]
remote:
remote:          When the system boots up, in the dmesg logs we can see the memory
remote:          statistics along with total reserved as below.  Memory: 458840k/458840k
remote:          available, 65448k reserved, 0K highmem
remote:
remote:          When CMA is enabled, still the total reserved memory remains the same.
remote:          However, the CMA memory is not considered as reserved.  But, when we see
remote:          /proc/meminfo, the CMA memory is part of free memory.  This creates
remote:          confusion.  This patch corrects the problem by properly subtracting the
remote:          CMA reserved memory from the total reserved memory in dmesg logs.
remote:
remote:          Below is the dmesg snapshot from an arm based device with 512MB RAM and
remote:          12MB single CMA region.
remote:
remote:          Before this change:
remote:            Memory: 458840k/458840k available, 65448k reserved, 0K highmem
remote:
remote:          After this change:
remote:            Memory: 458840k/458840k available, 53160k reserved, 12288k cma-reserved, 0K highmem

remote:          mm: cma: align to physical address, not CMA region position
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit b5be83e308f70e16c63c4e520ea7bb03ef57c46f]
remote:
remote:          The alignment in cma_alloc() was done w.r.t. the bitmap.  This is a
remote:          problem when, for example:
remote:
remote:          - a device requires 16M (order 12) alignment
remote:          - the CMA region is not 16 M aligned
remote:
remote:          In such a case, can result with the CMA region starting at, say,
remote:          0x2f800000 but any allocation you make from there will be aligned from
remote:          there.  Requesting an allocation of 32 M with 16 M alignment will result
remote:          in an allocation from 0x2f800000 to 0x31800000, which doesn't work very
remote:          well if your strange device requires 16M alignment.
remote:
remote:          Change to use bitmap_find_next_zero_area_off() to account for the
remote:          difference in alignment at reserve-time and alloc-time.

remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit dae803e165a11bc88ca8dbc07a11077caf97bbcb]
remote:
remote:          Having test_pages_isolated failure message as a warning confuses users
remote:          into thinking that it is more serious than it really is.  In reality, if
remote:          called via CMA, allocation will be retried so a single
remote:          test_pages_isolated failure does not prevent allocation from succeeding.
remote:
remote:          Demote the warning message to an info message and reformat it such that
remote:          the text "failed" does not appear and instead a less worrying "PFNS
remote:          busy" is used.
remote:
remote:          This message is trivially reproducible on a 10GB x86 machine on 3.16.y

remote:          tmon: tui: fixup windowing calculations
remote:
remote:          The number of rows in the dialog vary according to the number of cooling
remote:          devices. However, some of the windowing computations were assuming a
remote:          fixed number of rows. This computation is OK when we have between 4 and
remote:          9 cooling devices (and they wrap to the next column), but with fewer
remote:          devices, we end up printing off the end of the window.
remote:
remote:          This unifies the row computation into a single function and uses that
remote:          throughout the TUI code. This also accounts for increasing the number of
remote:          rows when there are more than 9 total cooling devices.

remote:          CMA: use total cma pages for adjust_managed_cma_page_count
remote:
remote:          In the previous commit ("CMA: aggressively allocate the pages on CMA reserved
remote:          memory when not used" by Joonsoo Kim), CMA allocation is changed to be based on
remote:          the total number of "normal" managed pages and the number of managed (aka not
remote:          CMA-allocated) CMA pages.  This was intended to be used in conjunction with a
remote:          commit "CMA: always treat free cma pages as non-free on watermark checking"[1].
remote:          However, including that change results in a severe limitation that cannot be
remote:          used on brcmstb with the current setup: it restricts the amount of CMA region
remote:          memory to be less than or equal to to one-half of the system memory.
remote:
remote:          Rather than applying that change, this alters the heuristic from the
remote:          previous commit: we change the definition of "normal" manages in a zone from
remote:
remote:            total pages - managed (unallocated) CMA pages - high_wmark_pages(zone)
remote:
remote:          to
remote:
remote:            total pages - total CMA pages
remote:
remote:          This eliminates the need to handle determining whether an allocation should
remote:          succeed or fail based on the watermark check, and allows for memory in CMA
remote:          regions to be used for movable allocations even if there isn't any extra room
remote:          to migrate them out of the CMA region.
remote:
remote:          The obvious and rather large caveat is that in the event of a CMA allocation
remote:          actually requiring that space, there might not be enough space available to
remote:          which to move the used pages in the CMA region, resulting in potentially
remote:          catastrophic CMA allocation failures.  Whereas Joonsoo's commit prevents that
remote:          by design but restricts CMA usage, this maintains flexibility for CMA region
remote:          use but leaves it to the system designer to handle CMA allocation failure.

remote:          CMA: aggressively allocate the pages on CMA reserved memory when not used
remote:
remote:          [Retrieved from
remote:          https://github.com/JoonsooKim/linux/commit/33a0416b3ac1cd7c88e6b35ee61b4a81a7a14afc]
remote:
remote:          CMA is introduced to provide physically contiguous pages at runtime.
remote:          For this purpose, it reserves memory at boot time. Although it reserve
remote:          memory, this reserved memory can be used for movable memory allocation
remote:          request. This usecase is beneficial to the system that needs this CMA
remote:          reserved memory infrequently and it is one of main purpose of
remote:          introducing CMA.
remote:
remote:          But, there is a problem in current implementation. The problem is that
remote:          it works like as just reserved memory approach. The pages on CMA reserved
remote:          memory are hardly used for movable memory allocation. This is caused by
remote:          combination of allocation and reclaim policy.
remote:
remote:          The pages on CMA reserved memory are allocated if there is no movable
remote:          memory, that is, as fallback allocation. So the time this fallback
remote:          allocation is started is under heavy memory pressure. Although it is under
remote:          memory pressure, movable allocation easily succeed, since there would be
remote:          many pages on CMA reserved memory. But this is not the case for unmovable
remote:          and reclaimable allocation, because they can't use the pages on CMA
remote:          reserved memory. These allocations regard system's free memory as
remote:          (free pages - free CMA pages) on watermark checking, that is, free
remote:          unmovable pages + free reclaimable pages + free movable pages. Because
remote:          we already exhausted movable pages, only free pages we have are unmovable
remote:          and reclaimable types and this would be really small amount. So watermark
remote:          checking would be failed. It will wake up kswapd to make enough free
remote:          memory for unmovable and reclaimable allocation and kswapd will do.
remote:          So before we fully utilize pages on CMA reserved memory, kswapd start to
remote:          reclaim memory and try to make free memory over the high watermark. This
remote:          watermark checking by kswapd doesn't take care free CMA pages so many
remote:          movable pages would be reclaimed. After then, we have a lot of movable
remote:          pages again, so fallback allocation doesn't happen again. To conclude,
remote:          amount of free memory on meminfo which includes free CMA pages is moving
remote:          around 512 MB if I reserve 512 MB memory for CMA.
remote:
remote:          I found this problem on following experiment.
remote:
remote:          4 CPUs, 1024 MB, VIRTUAL MACHINE
remote:          make -j16
remote:
remote:          CMA reserve:            0 MB            512 MB
remote:          Elapsed-time:           225.2           472.5
remote:          Average-MemFree:        322490 KB       630839 KB
remote:
remote:          To solve this problem, I can think following 2 possible solutions.
remote:          1. allocate the pages on CMA reserved memory first, and if they are
remote:             exhausted, allocate movable pages.
remote:          2. interleaved allocation: try to allocate specific amounts of memory
remote:             from CMA reserved memory and then allocate from free movable memory.
remote:
remote:          I tested #1 approach and found the problem. Although free memory on
remote:          meminfo can move around low watermark, there is large fluctuation on free
remote:          memory, because too many pages are reclaimed when kswapd is invoked.
remote:          Reason for this behaviour is that successive allocated CMA pages are
remote:          on the LRU list in that order and kswapd reclaim them in same order.
remote:          These memory doesn't help watermark checking from kwapd, so too many
remote:          pages are reclaimed, I guess.
remote:
remote:          So, I implement #2 approach.
remote:          One thing I should note is that we should not change allocation target
remote:          (movable list or CMA) on each allocation attempt, since this prevent
remote:          allocated pages to be in physically succession, so some I/O devices can
remote:          be hurt their performance. To solve this, I keep allocation target
remote:          in at least pageblock_nr_pages attempts and make this number reflect
remote:          ratio, free pages without free CMA pages to free CMA pages. With this
remote:          approach, system works very smoothly and fully utilize the pages on
remote:          CMA reserved memory.
remote:
remote:          Following is the experimental result of this patch.

remote:
remote:          There is no difference if we don't have CMA reserved memory (0 MB case).
remote:          But, with CMA reserved memory (512 MB case), we fully utilize these
remote:          reserved memory through this patch and the system behaves like as
remote:          it doesn't reserve any memory.
remote:
remote:          With this patch, we aggressively allocate the pages on CMA reserved memory
remote:          so latency of CMA can arise. Below is the experimental result about
remote:          latency.
remote:
remote:          4 CPUs, 1024 MB, VIRTUAL MACHINE
remote:          CMA reserve: 512 MB
remote:          Backgound Workload: make -jN
remote:          Real Workload: 8 MB CMA allocation/free 20 times with 5 sec interval
remote:
remote:          N:                    1        4       8        16
remote:          Elapsed-time(Before): 4309.75  9511.09 12276.1  77103.5
remote:          Elapsed-time(After):  5391.69 16114.1  19380.3  34879.2
remote:
remote:          So generally we can see latency increase. Ratio of this increase
remote:          is rather big - up to 70%. But, under the heavy workload, it shows
remote:          latency decrease - up to 55%. This may be worst-case scenario, but
remote:          reducing it would be important for some system, so, I can say that
remote:          this patch have advantages and disadvantages in terms of latency.
remote:
remote:          Although I think that this patch is right direction for CMA, there is
remote:          side-effect in following case. If there is small memory zone and CMA
remote:          occupys most of them, LRU for this zone would have many CMA pages. When
remote:          reclaim is started, these CMA pages would be reclaimed, but not counted
remote:          for watermark checking, so too many CMA pages could be reclaimed
remote:          unnecessarily. Until now, this can't happen because free CMA pages aren't
remote:          used easily. But, with this patch, free CMA pages are used easily so
remote:          this problem can be possible. I will handle it on another patchset
remote:          after some investigating.
remote:
remote:          v2:
remote:            - In fastpath, just replenish counters. Calculation is done whenver
remote:              CMA area is varied
remote:
remote:          v3:
remote:            - Use unsigned type in adjust_managed_cma_page_count() (per Gioh)
remote:            - Fix +/- count when calling adjust_managed_cma_page_count() (per Gioh)
remote:            - Instead of implementing __rmqueue_cma() which has another
remote:              __rmqueue_smallest(), choose_rmqueue_migratetype() is implemented to
remote:              change original migratetype to MIGRATE_CMA according to criteria. It
remote:              helps not to violate layering. (per Minchan in offline discussion)

remote:          CMA: remove redundant retrying code in __alloc_contig_migrate_range
remote:
remote:          [Upstream submission (not yet accepted) https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/5/28/113]
remote:
remote:          We already have retry logic in migrate_pages(). It does retry 10 times.
remote:          So if we keep this retrying code in __alloc_contig_migrate_range(), we
remote:          would try to migrate some unmigratable page in 50 times. There is just one
remote:          small difference in -ENOMEM case. migrate_pages() don't do retry
remote:          in this case, however, current __alloc_contig_migrate_range() does. But,
remote:          I think that this isn't problem, because in this case, we may fail again
remote:          with same reason.

remote:          mm/page_alloc: restrict max order of merging on isolated pageblock
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 3c605096d3158216ba9326a16266f6ba128c2c8d]
remote:
remote:          Current pageblock isolation logic could isolate each pageblock
remote:          individually.  This causes freepage accounting problem if freepage with
remote:          pageblock order on isolate pageblock is merged with other freepage on
remote:          normal pageblock.  We can prevent merging by restricting max order of
remote:          merging to pageblock order if freepage is on isolate pageblock.
remote:
remote:          A side-effect of this change is that there could be non-merged buddy
remote:          freepage even if finishing pageblock isolation, because undoing
remote:          pageblock isolation is just to move freepage from isolate buddy list to
remote:          normal buddy list rather than to consider merging.  So, the patch also
remote:          makes undoing pageblock isolation consider freepage merge.  When
remote:          un-isolation, freepage with more than pageblock order and it's buddy are
remote:          checked.  If they are on normal pageblock, instead of just moving, we
remote:          isolate the freepage and free it in order to get merged.

remote:          mm/page_alloc: add freepage on isolate pageblock to correct buddy list
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 51bb1a4093cc68bc16b282548d9cee6104be0ef1]
remote:
remote:          In free_pcppages_bulk(), we use cached migratetype of freepage to
remote:          determine type of buddy list where freepage will be added.  This
remote:          information is stored when freepage is added to pcp list, so if
remote:          isolation of pageblock of this freepage begins after storing, this
remote:          cached information could be stale.  In other words, it has original
remote:          migratetype rather than MIGRATE_ISOLATE.
remote:
remote:          There are two problems caused by this stale information.
remote:
remote:          One is that we can't keep these freepages from being allocated.
remote:          Although this pageblock is isolated, freepage will be added to normal
remote:          buddy list so that it could be allocated without any restriction.  And
remote:          the other problem is incorrect freepage accounting.  Freepages on
remote:          isolate pageblock should not be counted for number of freepage.
remote:
remote:          Following is the code snippet in free_pcppages_bulk().
remote:
remote:              /* MIGRATE_MOVABLE list may include MIGRATE_RESERVEs */
remote:              __free_one_page(page, page_to_pfn(page), zone, 0, mt);
remote:              trace_mm_page_pcpu_drain(page, 0, mt);
remote:              if (likely(!is_migrate_isolate_page(page))) {
remote:                  __mod_zone_page_state(zone, NR_FREE_PAGES, 1);
remote:                  if (is_migrate_cma(mt))
remote:                      __mod_zone_page_state(zone, NR_FREE_CMA_PAGES, 1);
remote:              }
remote:
remote:          As you can see above snippet, current code already handle second
remote:          problem, incorrect freepage accounting, by re-fetching pageblock
remote:          migratetype through is_migrate_isolate_page(page).
remote:
remote:          But, because this re-fetched information isn't used for
remote:          __free_one_page(), first problem would not be solved.  This patch try to
remote:          solve this situation to re-fetch pageblock migratetype before
remote:          __free_one_page() and to use it for __free_one_page().
remote:
remote:          In addition to move up position of this re-fetch, this patch use
remote:          optimization technique, re-fetching migratetype only if there is isolate
remote:          pageblock.  Pageblock isolation is rare event, so we can avoid
remote:          re-fetching in common case with this optimization.
remote:
remote:          This patch also correct migratetype of the tracepoint output.

remote:          mm/page_alloc: fix incorrect isolation behavior by rechecking migratetype
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit ad53f92eb416d81e469fa8ea57153e59455e7175]
remote:
remote:          Before describing bugs itself, I first explain definition of freepage.
remote:
remote:           1. pages on buddy list are counted as freepage.
remote:           2. pages on isolate migratetype buddy list are *not* counted as freepage.
remote:           3. pages on cma buddy list are counted as CMA freepage, too.
remote:
remote:          Now, I describe problems and related patch.
remote:
remote:          Patch 1: There is race conditions on getting pageblock migratetype that
remote:          it results in misplacement of freepages on buddy list, incorrect
remote:          freepage count and un-availability of freepage.
remote:
remote:          Patch 2: Freepages on pcp list could have stale cached information to
remote:          determine migratetype of buddy list to go.  This causes misplacement of
remote:          freepages on buddy list and incorrect freepage count.
remote:
remote:          Patch 4: Merging between freepages on different migratetype of
remote:          pageblocks will cause freepages accouting problem.  This patch fixes it.
remote:
remote:          Without patchset [3], above problem doesn't happens on my CMA allocation
remote:          test, because CMA reserved pages aren't used at all.  So there is no
remote:          chance for above race.
remote:
remote:          With patchset [3], I did simple CMA allocation test and get below
remote:          result:
remote:
remote:           - Virtual machine, 4 cpus, 1024 MB memory, 256 MB CMA reservation
remote:           - run kernel build (make -j16) on background
remote:           - 30 times CMA allocation(8MB * 30 = 240MB) attempts in 5 sec interval
remote:           - Result: more than 5000 freepage count are missed
remote:
remote:          With patchset [3] and this patchset, I found that no freepage count are
remote:          missed so that I conclude that problems are solved.
remote:
remote:          On my simple memory offlining test, these problems also occur on that
remote:          environment, too.
remote:
remote:          This patch (of 4):
remote:
remote:          There are two paths to reach core free function of buddy allocator,
remote:          __free_one_page(), one is free_one_page()->__free_one_page() and the
remote:          other is free_hot_cold_page()->free_pcppages_bulk()->__free_one_page().
remote:          Each paths has race condition causing serious problems.  At first, this
remote:          patch is focused on first type of freepath.  And then, following patch
remote:          will solve the problem in second type of freepath.
remote:
remote:          In the first type of freepath, we got migratetype of freeing page
remote:          without holding the zone lock, so it could be racy.  There are two cases
remote:          of this race.
remote:
remote:           1. pages are added to isolate buddy list after restoring orignal
remote:              migratetype
remote:
remote:              CPU1                                   CPU2
remote:
remote:              get migratetype => return MIGRATE_ISOLATE
remote:              call free_one_page() with MIGRATE_ISOLATE
remote:
remote:                                          grab the zone lock
remote:                                          unisolate pageblock
remote:                                          release the zone lock
remote:
remote:              grab the zone lock
remote:              call __free_one_page() with MIGRATE_ISOLATE
remote:              freepage go into isolate buddy list,
remote:              although pageblock is already unisolated
remote:
remote:          This may cause two problems.  One is that we can't use this page anymore
remote:          until next isolation attempt of this pageblock, because freepage is on
remote:          isolate buddy list.  The other is that freepage accouting could be wrong
remote:          due to merging between different buddy list.  Freepages on isolate buddy
remote:          list aren't counted as freepage, but ones on normal buddy list are
remote:          counted as freepage.  If merge happens, buddy freepage on normal buddy
remote:          list is inevitably moved to isolate buddy list without any consideration
remote:          of freepage accouting so it could be incorrect.
remote:
remote:           2. pages are added to normal buddy list while pageblock is isolated.
remote:              It is similar with above case.
remote:
remote:          This also may cause two problems.  One is that we can't keep these
remote:          freepages from being allocated.  Although this pageblock is isolated,
remote:          freepage would be added to normal buddy list so that it could be
remote:          allocated without any restriction.  And the other problem is same as
remote:          case 1, that it, incorrect freepage accouting.
remote:
remote:          This race condition would be prevented by checking migratetype again
remote:          with holding the zone lock.  Because it is somewhat heavy operation and
remote:          it isn't needed in common case, we want to avoid rechecking as much as
remote:          possible.  So this patch introduce new variable, nr_isolate_pageblock in
remote:          struct zone to check if there is isolated pageblock.  With this, we can
remote:          avoid to re-check migratetype in common case and do it only if there is
remote:          isolated pageblock or migratetype is MIGRATE_ISOLATE.  This solve above
remote:          mentioned problems.
remote:
remote:          Changes from v3:
remote:          Add one more check in free_one_page() that checks whether migratetype is
remote:          MIGRATE_ISOLATE or not. Without this, abovementioned case 1 could happens.

remote:          mm: cma: Ensure that reservations never cross the low/high mem boundary
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 16195ddd4ebcc10c30b2f232f8e400df8d464380]
remote:
remote:          Commit 95b0e655f914 ("ARM: mm: don't limit default CMA region only to
remote:          low memory") extended CMA memory reservation to allow usage of high
remote:          memory. It relied on commit f7426b983a6a ("mm: cma: adjust address limit
remote:          to avoid hitting low/high memory boundary") to ensure that the reserved
remote:          block never crossed the low/high memory boundary. While the
remote:          implementation correctly lowered the limit, it failed to consider the
remote:          case where the base..limit range crossed the low/high memory boundary
remote:          with enough space on each side to reserve the requested size on either
remote:          low or high memory.
remote:
remote:          Rework the base and limit adjustment to fix the problem. The function
remote:          now starts by rejecting the reservation altogether for fixed
remote:          reservations that cross the boundary, tries to reserve from high memory
remote:          first and then falls back to low memory.

remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 800a85d3d286604b8c539ca7ee90b992316fd2a7]
remote:
remote:          The fixed parameter to cma_declare_contiguous() tells the function
remote:          whether the given base address must be honoured or should be considered
remote:          as a hint only. The API considers a zero base address as meaning any
remote:          base address, which must never be considered as a fixed value.
remote:
remote:          Part of the implementation correctly checks both fixed and base != 0,
remote:          but two locations check the fixed value only. Set fixed to false when
remote:          base is 0 to fix that and simplify the code.

remote:          mm/cma: fix cma bitmap aligned mask computing
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 68faed630fc151a7a1c4853df00fb3dcacf782b4]
remote:
remote:          The current cma bitmap aligned mask computation is incorrect.  It could
remote:          cause an unexpected alignment when using cma_alloc() if the wanted align
remote:          order is larger than cma->order_per_bit.
remote:
remote:          Take kvm for example (PAGE_SHIFT = 12), kvm_cma->order_per_bit is set to
remote:          6.  When kvm_alloc_rma() tries to alloc kvm_rma_pages, it will use 15 as
remote:          the expected align value.  After using the current implementation however,
remote:          we get 0 as cma bitmap aligned mask other than 511.
remote:
remote:          This patch fixes the cma bitmap aligned mask calculation.

remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit f7426b983a6a353cf21e5733e84458219c4a817e]
remote:
remote:          Russell King recently noticed that limiting default CMA region only to low
remote:          memory on ARM architecture causes serious memory management issues with
remote:          machines having a lot of memory (which is mainly available as high
remote:          memory).  More information can be found the following thread:
remote:          http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.ports.arm.kernel/348441/
remote:
remote:          Those two patches removes this limit letting kernel to put default CMA
remote:          region into high memory when this is possible (there is enough high memory
remote:          available and architecture specific DMA limit fits).
remote:
remote:          This should solve strange OOM issues on systems with lots of RAM (i.e.
remote:          >1GiB) and large (>256M) CMA area.
remote:
remote:          This patch (of 2):
remote:
remote:          Automatically allocated regions should not cross low/high memory boundary,
remote:          because such regions cannot be later correctly initialized due to spanning
remote:          across two memory zones.  This patch adds a check for this case and a
remote:          simple code for moving region to low memory if automatically selected
remote:          address might not fit completely into high memory.

remote:
remote:          Currently, there are two users on CMA functionality, one is the DMA

remote:          to manage CMA reserved area even if they looks really similar.  From my
remote:          guess, it is caused by some needs on bitmap management.  KVM side wants
remote:          to maintain bitmap not for 1 page, but for more size.  Eventually it use
remote:          bitmap where one bit represents 64 pages.
remote:
remote:          When I implement CMA related patches, I should change those two places
remote:          to apply my change and it seem to be painful to me.  I want to change
remote:          this situation and reduce future code management overhead through this
remote:          patch.
remote:
remote:          This change could also help developer who want to use CMA in their new
remote:          feature development, since they can use CMA easily without copying &
remote:          pasting this reserved area management code.
remote:
remote:          In previous patches, we have prepared some features to generalize CMA
remote:          reserved area management and now it's time to do it.  This patch moves
remote:          core functions to mm/cma.c and change DMA APIs to use these functions.
remote:
remote:          There is no functional change in DMA APIs.

remote:          cma: add placement specifier for "cma=" kernel parameter
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 5ea3b1b2f8ad9162684431ce6188102ca4c64b7a]
remote:
remote:          Currently, "cma=" kernel parameter is used to specify the size of CMA,
remote:          but we can't specify where it is located.  We want to locate CMA below
remote:          4GB for devices only supporting 32-bit addressing on 64-bit systems
remote:          without iommu.
remote:
remote:          This enables to specify the placement of CMA by extending "cma=" kernel
remote:          parameter.
remote:
remote:          Examples:
remote:           1. locate 64MB CMA below 4GB by "cma=64M@0-4G"
remote:           2. locate 64MB CMA exact at 512MB by "cma=64M@512M"
remote:
remote:          Note that the DMA contiguous memory allocator on x86 assumes that
remote:          page_address() works for the pages to allocate.  So this change requires
remote:          to limit end address of contiguous memory area upto max_pfn_mapped to
remote:          prevent from locating it on highmem area by the argument of
remote:          dma_contiguous_reserve().

remote:
remote:          CMA locking is currently very coarse. The cma_mutex protects both
remote:          the bitmap and avoids concurrency with alloc_contig_range. There
remote:          are several situations which may result in a deadlock on the CMA
remote:          mutex currently, mostly involving AB/BA situations with alloc and
remote:          free. Fix this issue by protecting the bitmap with a mutex per CMA
remote:          region and use the existing mutex for protecting against concurrency
remote:          with alloc_contig_range.

remote:
remote:          Various TP optimizations for DHD/4366 3390 platforms:
remote:
remote:          - integrated interrupt coalescence for CPU utilization
remote:          - added PACKET_BUDGET batching of DQM reads in TX direction.
remote:          - tweaked structures for Cache line optimizations.
remote:          - added Branch prediction hints in DHD shim.
remote:          - additional inlining and BCM_FASTPATH additions.
remote:          - switched back to KTHREAD from tasklets in 3390
remote:          - introduced BUZZZ profiling framework in data path
remote:          - resolved WiFi: "FPM Pool 0: pool full" errors while running concurrent traffic
remote:          through both wifi radios.

remote:
remote:          Since not all hardware and usage cases for 3384 platforms support usage
remote:          of a hardware interrupt, a polling mode has been added to poll for IRQ
remote:          status. This is timer based, and adjust polling frequency based on the
remote:          amount of speed needed for IRQ response. Polling mode is enabled by commenting
remote:          out the interrupt nodes in the bmoca device tree node.

remote:
remote:          The UNIMAC MBDMA transmit channels were not being set up to optimally use
remote:          the UBUS multiple outstanding request feature. This feature allows the DMA

remote:          to not be as fast as they could be and was affecting performance. This setting
remote:          has now been bumped to 4 outstanding requests.

remote:  - Create a proprietary LKM that can periodically poll the MemC
remote:    Statistics registers of the 3390B0 and pull all of the stats into a
remote:  somewhat small array for short-term collection.  The driver always
remote:  collects the stats for the entire controller and can be put in a mode to
remote:  collect either the VIPER bus stats or the ARM/SCB bus stats.
remote:
remote:  - Create a userspace apps that loads the LKM and is able to configure it
remote:    and poll it for longer-term data collection and collation.  The app
remote:  grabs the LKM's data and stores it into a long-term buffer after
remote:  calculating numerous memc statistics (provided by Herman Liu) on the
remote:  data. It is able to fully unload the LKM given a specific option as
remote:  well.
remote:
remote:  - Portions of the LKM came from some BRCM DSL code that was created on a
remote:    similar Memory Controller.  I heavily modified it to do what Dave P
remote:  asked for for the 3390B0.
remote:
remote:  - Both the LKM and the app are DISABLED by default in the build.  They
remote:    can be enabled by flipping CONFIG_BCM_MEMCSTATS to 'm' in
remote:  linux/drivers/bcm_media_gw/Kconfig.  This will automagically flip the
remote:  userspace BUILD_MEMCSTATS flag to y and build both.
remote:
remote:  - Added the userspace app to the two skiplists I'm aware of.  The LKM
remote:    should already be handled by one of the lines in those two files.
remote:
remote:  - the _proc file was left in place but is not compiled in case it's
remote:    needed for future debugging.  Early on I used it for basic debugging
remote:  of the LKM.  But later removed it when it was no longer essential.

remote:  netfilter: conntrack: remove central spinlock nf_conntrack_lock
remote:
remote:  nf_conntrack_lock is a monolithic lock and suffers from huge contention
remote:  on current generation servers (8 or more core/threads).
remote:
remote:  Perf locking congestion is clear on base kernel:
remote:
remote:  -  72.56%  ksoftirqd/6  [kernel.kallsyms]    [k] _raw_spin_lock_bh
remote:     - _raw_spin_lock_bh
remote:        + 25.33% init_conntrack
remote:        + 24.86% nf_ct_delete_from_lists
remote:        + 24.62% __nf_conntrack_confirm
remote:        + 24.38% destroy_conntrack
remote:        + 0.70% tcp_packet
remote:  +   2.21%  ksoftirqd/6  [kernel.kallsyms]    [k] fib_table_lookup
remote:  +   1.15%  ksoftirqd/6  [kernel.kallsyms]    [k] __slab_free
remote:  +   0.77%  ksoftirqd/6  [kernel.kallsyms]    [k] inet_getpeer
remote:  +   0.70%  ksoftirqd/6  [nf_conntrack]       [k] nf_ct_delete
remote:  +   0.55%  ksoftirqd/6  [ip_tables]          [k] ipt_do_table
remote:
remote:  This patch change conntrack locking and provides a huge performance
remote:  improvement.  SYN-flood attack tested on a 24-core E5-2695v2(ES) with
remote:  10Gbit/s ixgbe (with tool trafgen):
remote:
remote:   Base kernel:   810.405 new conntrack/sec
remote:   After patch: 2.233.876 new conntrack/sec
remote:
remote:  Notice other floods attack (SYN+ACK or ACK) can easily be deflected using:
remote:   # iptables -A INPUT -m state --state INVALID -j DROP
remote:   # sysctl -w net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_tcp_loose=0
remote:
remote:  Use an array of hashed spinlocks to protect insertions/deletions of
remote:  conntracks into the hash table. 1024 spinlocks seem to give good
remote:  results, at minimal cost (4KB memory). Due to lockdep max depth,
remote:  1024 becomes 8 if CONFIG_LOCKDEP=y
remote:
remote:  The hash resize is a bit tricky, because we need to take all locks in
remote:  the array. A seqcount_t is used to synchronize the hash table users
remote:  with the resizing process.

remote:  netfilter: avoid race with exp->master ct
remote:
remote:  Preparation for disconnecting the nf_conntrack_lock from the
remote:  expectations code.  Once the nf_conntrack_lock is lifted, a race
remote:  condition is exposed.
remote:
remote:  The expectations master conntrack exp->master, can race with
remote:  delete operations, as the refcnt increment happens too late in
remote:  init_conntrack().  Race is against other CPUs invoking
remote:  ->destroy() (destroy_conntrack()), or nf_ct_delete() (via timeout
remote:  or early_drop()).
remote:
remote:  Avoid this race in nf_ct_find_expectation() by using atomic_inc_not_zero(),
remote:  and checking if nf_ct_is_dying() (path via nf_ct_delete()).

remote:          brcmstb_defconfig: Compress kernel with XZ instead of GZIP
remote:
remote:          GZIP is the default kernel compression method, while it is a good tradeoff
remote:          between compression ratio and speed, recent additions to the default kernel
remote:          have made us get too close from the 4MB size, which is the typical "kernel"
remote:          partition provided by BOLT. Until we can afford not caring about size, switch
remote:          to the strongest compression algorithm that is supported: XZ, putting us back
remote:          into the safe zone for a while.

remote:          gpio: brcmstb: Fix wake-up on GPIO interrupts
remote:
remote:          The current driver was missing a few key things to allow GPIO interrupts to be
remote:          properly used as wake-up sources as intended:
remote:
remote:          - the IRQCHIP_MASK_ON_SUSPEND should only apply to the non wake-up capable
remote:            controllers
remote:          - we need to know which GPIO interrupt line is requested to be a
remote:            wake-up source, and program its interrupt mask accordingly to make it able to
remote:            wake-up the system
remote:
remote:          In order to accomplish that, we introduce a per-GPIO bank bitmask of active
remote:          sources (wake_active) and program it into GIO_MASK when we are about to
remote:          suspend.

remote:          xfs: remote attribute overwrite causes transaction overrun
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 8275cdd0e7ac550dcce2b3ef6d2fb3b808c1ae59]
remote:
remote:          Commit e461fcb ("xfs: remote attribute lookups require the value
remote:          length") passes the remote attribute length in the xfs_da_args
remote:          structure on lookup so that CRC calculations and validity checking
remote:          can be performed correctly by related code. This, unfortunately has
remote:          the side effect of changing the args->valuelen parameter in cases
remote:          where it shouldn't.
remote:
remote:          That is, when we replace a remote attribute, the incoming
remote:          replacement stores the value and length in args->value and
remote:          args->valuelen, but then the lookup which finds the existing remote
remote:          attribute overwrites args->valuelen with the length of the remote
remote:          attribute being replaced. Hence when we go to create the new
remote:          attribute, we create it of the size of the existing remote
remote:          attribute, not the size it is supposed to be. When the new attribute
remote:          is much smaller than the old attribute, this results in a
remote:          transaction overrun and an ASSERT() failure on a debug kernel:
remote:
remote:          XFS: Assertion failed: tp->t_blk_res_used <= tp->t_blk_res, file: fs/xfs/xfs_trans.c, line: 331
remote:
remote:          Fix this by keeping the remote attribute value length separate to
remote:          the attribute value length in the xfs_da_args structure. The enables
remote:          us to pass the length of the remote attribute to be removed without
remote:          overwriting the new attribute's length.
remote:
remote:          Also, ensure that when we save remote block contexts for a later
remote:          rename we zero the original state variables so that we don't confuse
remote:          the state of the attribute to be removes with the state of the new
remote:          attribute that we just added. [Spotted by Brain Foster.]

remote:          BCMGENET: Power up the internal PHY before probing the MII
remote:
remote:          When using the internal PHY it must be powered up when the MII is probed
remote:          or the PHY will not be detected.  Since the PHY is powered up at reset
remote:          this has not been a problem.  However, when the kernel is restarted with
remote:          kexec the PHY will likely be powered down when the kernel starts so it
remote:          will not be detected and the Ethernet link will not be established.
remote:
remote:          This commit explicitly powers up the internal PHY when the GENET driver

remote:          KEYS: Fix keyring ref leak in join_session_keyring()
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 23567fd052a9abb6d67fe8e7a9ccdd9800a540f2]
remote:
remote:          This fixes CVE-2016-0728.
remote:
remote:          If a thread is asked to join as a session keyring the keyring that's already
remote:          set as its session, we leak a keyring reference.
remote:
remote:          This can be tested with the following program:
remote:
remote:          	#include <stddef.h>
remote:          	#include <stdio.h>
remote:          	#include <sys/types.h>
remote:          	#include <keyutils.h>
remote:
remote:          	int main(int argc, const char *argv[])
remote:          	{
remote:          		int i = 0;
remote:          		key_serial_t serial;
remote:
remote:          		serial = keyctl(KEYCTL_JOIN_SESSION_KEYRING,
remote:          				"leaked-keyring");
remote:          		if (serial < 0) {
remote:          			perror("keyctl");
remote:          			return -1;
remote:          		}
remote:
remote:          		if (keyctl(KEYCTL_SETPERM, serial,
remote:          			   KEY_POS_ALL | KEY_USR_ALL) < 0) {
remote:          			perror("keyctl");
remote:          			return -1;
remote:          		}
remote:
remote:          		for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
remote:          			serial = keyctl(KEYCTL_JOIN_SESSION_KEYRING,
remote:          					"leaked-keyring");
remote:          			if (serial < 0) {
remote:          				perror("keyctl");
remote:          				return -1;
remote:          			}
remote:          		}
remote:
remote:          		return 0;
remote:          	}
remote:
remote:          If, after the program has run, there something like the following line in
remote:          /proc/keys:
remote:
remote:          3f3d898f I--Q---   100 perm 3f3f0000     0     0 keyring   leaked-keyring: empty
remote:
remote:          with a usage count of 100 * the number of times the program has been run,
remote:          then the kernel is malfunctioning.  If leaked-keyring has zero usages or
remote:          has been garbage collected, then the problem is fixed.

remote:
remote:          When generating an address for bmem_find_region() from a pfn value we

remote:          type causing the address to unintentionally wrap.  This in turn can
remote:          cause a highmem address above 4GB to wrap back into the 4GB range and
remote:          be mistaken for being within a BMEM/BRCMSTB_CMA region.

remote:
remote:          This MSI implementation is complicated by two factors:
remote:
remote:          1. we have multiple root controllers (RC), each with their own MSI
remote:
remote:          2. we have some chips implemented where the PCIe interrupt is shared
remote:          with the MSI interrupt.  In addition, the MSI interrupt bits do
remote:          not have their own register; there are 8 bits starting at position
remote:          24 in the L2 interrupt register.

remote:          usb: USB 3.0 device as rootfs fails to recover after S2 or S3
remote:
remote:          On systems using IPP (Invert Port Power), mounted USB 3.0
remote:          devices will get re-enumerated on S3 resume and the mounted
remote:          filesystem will no longer be accessible. This is happening
remote:          because a system using IPP will power up with USB power
remote:          enabled to the USB devices until the IPP can be set by software.
remote:          This is enough time for 3.0 devices to timeout on the 3.0
remote:          connect attempt (because the 3.0 PHY has not yet been enabled)
remote:          and fall back to a 2.0 device. This shouldn't be a problem
remote:          because the 3.0 devices in 2.0 mode would normally be power
remote:          cycled after the software sets IPP correctly, but the USB driver
remote:          turns on device power so quickly after we set IPP that the device
remote:          doesn't see the power cycle (on a 7445SV board it takes about
remote:          8ms for power to drop to zero). This change adds a 50ms delay
remote:          when IPP is being set. The delay is only added if IPP was not
remote:          already set to avoid delays if BOLT already set IPP.

remote:          gpio: brcmstb: define irq_disable service
remote:
remote:          The gpiolib irqchip helpers will use irq_unmask if irq_enable is not
remote:          defined.  However, when using the handle_simple_irq() generic handler
remote:          the irq_disable service will not use irq_mask to disable the interrupt.
remote:
remote:          When using the handle_simple_irq() generic handler it should be enough
remote:          to define irq_enable and irq_disable, but since we are using the flag
remote:          IRQCHIP_MASK_ON_SUSPEND we need to define the irq_mask as well.
remote:
remote:          This commit just defines irq_disabled the same as irq_mask so that
remote:          calls to disable_irq for gpio interrupts will mask the interrupt.

remote:          pstore/ram: Strip ramoops header for correct decompression
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit a28726b4fb624f81d637a8afb9ea12fc16500f61]
remote:
remote:          pstore compression/decompression was added during 3.12.
remote:          The ramoops driver prepends a "====timestamp.timestamp-C|D\n"
remote:          header to the compressed record before handing it over to pstore
remote:          driver which doesn't know about the header. In pstore_decompress(),
remote:          the pstore driver reads the first "==" as a zlib header, so the
remote:          decompression always fails. For example, this causes the driver
remote:          to write /dev/pstore/dmesg-ramoops-0.enc.z instead of
remote:          /dev/pstore/dmesg-ramoops-0.
remote:
remote:          This patch makes the ramoops driver remove the header before
remote:          pstore decompression.

remote:
remote:          The brcmstb_thermal driver was not properly handling computations of

remote:          usb: Add connected retry on resume for non SS devices
remote:
remote:          Currently usb_port_resume waits for up to 2 seconds for CONNECT
remote:          status for SS devices only. This change will do the same thing for
remote:          non-SS devices even though the reason is a little different. This
remote:          will fix an issue where VBUS is turned off during system wide
remote:          "suspend to ram" and some 2.0 devices take greater than the current
remote:          max of 100ms to show connected after VBUS is enabled. This is most
remote:          commonly seen on hard drive based devices and USB3.0 devices plugged
remote:          into a 2.0 only port. This patch has been accepted upstream.

remote:          part of [CRNAND-57] we could do a PIO to verify erased page uncorr ecc
remote:          erorr to eliminate false positives.  But this has a side effect of running into

remote:          ARM: mmu: fix default vmalloc size for < 1GiB
remote:
remote:          The current default vmalloc size has been bumped up to
remote:          744MiB for platforms with >= 1 GiB (and if more than one
remote:          meminfo bank exists). As the memory banks > 760MiB (the
remote:          maximum lowmem size for a 3:1 kernel split) are split at
remote:          the lowmem/highmem boundary, the automatic bmem reservation
remote:          scheme breaks when 760MiB < memory size < 1GiB.
remote:
remote:          For example, if the bank size is 768MiB, it's split into
remote:          a 760MiB lowmem and 8MiB highmem bank. The bmem reservation
remote:          algorithm keeps all of the 760MiB for the system and only
remote:          ends up reserving 8MiB for bmem.
remote:
remote:          This patch sets the default vmalloc size for memory banks
remote:          > 760MiB to 744MiB. The change ensures the bmem automatic
remote:          reservation algorithm works correctly for 760MiB < memory
remote:          size < 1GiB.

remote:          brcmstb: memory: fix default bmem reservation
remote:
remote:          On single memory bank platforms, 20% of the available
remote:          memory is set aside for the system and the rest is reserved
remote:          as bmem. This scheme doesn't work well for very low memory
remote:          profiles (e.g. 256MiB), resulting in OOM conditions.
remote:
remote:          This patches adds the following changes to single memory
remote:          bank configurations:
remote:
remote:          - For bank sizes less than or equal to 128MiB, all memory
remote:          is allocated to the system and bmem reservation is skipped.
remote:
remote:          - For bank sizes larger than 128MiB,
remote:          reserved_bmem = 80% x (bank_size - 128MiB).

remote:          With BOLT v1.07, Device Tree contains a proper USB PHY Device Tree node
remote:          brcm_usb_instance_probe() bails out early because there is such a PHY, and so
remote:          we do not have a valid dev->drvdata pointer by the time we run

remote:          usb: Change Broadcom USB drivers structure to remove USB wrapper driver
remote:
remote:          The current Broadcom USB drivers (ohci, ehci, xhci and bdc) are setup
remote:          as child drivers to a USB wrapper driver. The wrapper driver handles
remote:          any global USB controller setup and then starts the child drivers. This
remote:          change will replace the wrapper driver with a usb-phy driver that will
remote:          do the global USB controller setup and the child drivers will become
remote:          normal drivers started by the device tree parser. The new functionality
remote:          requires a new style of USB Device Tree node descriptions and will
remote:          only work with a matching version of BOLT. The kernel will also support
remote:          the old style DT entries so it will work correctly with either version
remote:          of BOLT.

remote:          mmc: Add ability to change driver strength from a Device Tree prop
remote:
remote:          Customers are requesting the ability to change the Host and Card
remote:          Driver Type (drive strength) because they are seeing interference
remote:          with WiFi and having Certification issues. This change allows new
remote:          Device Tree properties to change the default Driver Type for both
remote:          Host and Card. Not all cards support all Driver Types and if the
remote:          requested type is not supported the default will continue to be used.
remote:          The SD spec states that only UHS modes use selectable driver strength,
remote:          but our host controller allows it for HS mode as well. A customer
remote:          has requested support for the HS setting so an additional device
remote:          tree property was added for this.
remote:
remote:          The Device Tree properties that control the drive strength are:
remote:          "host-driver-strength", "host-hs-driver-strength" and
remote:          "card-driver-strength". These properties can have the value
remote:          "A", "B", "C", or "D". Where A is x1.5, B is x1.0 (default),
remote:          C is x0.75 and D is x0.5
remote:
remote:          NOTES
remote:           o Reducing Drive Strength may result in read/write errors
remote:             depending on the board design.
remote:           o The Host side settings are not supported on the 74371, which
remote:             uses the older version of the SDIO core.

remote:          clk: Remove ordering restrictions for software clocks
remote:
remote:          After using "kexec" to load and run a new kernel, the new kernel
remote:          doesn't work normally.
remote:          1. It can't detect the plug/unplug of usb disk/ethernet cable.
remote:          2. If run with a usb disk plugged, there will be kernel panic.
remote:
remote:          This is the result of Software Clocks not setting up their parents
remote:          correctly when booting via kexec. The prevents the parent
remote:          clocks of the sw clock from being enabled. This is happening because
remote:          kexec uses /proc/device-tree to reconstruct the FDT that is used
remote:          to boot the new kernel and this changes the original node order to be
remote:          alphabetical and the clock software depends on the parent clock nodes
remote:          being defined before the software clock. This change removes the
remote:          ordering restriction and allows sw clocks and parents to be
remote:          defined in any order.

remote:          net: dsa: bcm_sf2: Fix ageing conditions and operation
remote:
remote:          The comparison check between cur_hw_state and hw_state is currently
remote:          invalid because cur_hw_state is right shifted by G_MISTP_SHIFT, while
remote:          hw_state is not, so we end-up comparing bits 2:0 with bits 7:5, which is
remote:          going to cause an additional aging to occur. Fix this by not shifting
remote:          cur_hw_state while reading it, but instead, mask the value with the
remote:          appropriately shitfted bitmask.
remote:
remote:          The other problem with the fast-ageing process is that we did not set
remote:          the EN_AGE_DYNAMIC bit to request the ageing to occur for dynamically
remote:          learned MAC addresses. Finally, write back 0 to the FAST_AGE_CTRL
remote:          register to avoid leaving spurious bits sets from one operation to the
remote:          other.

remote:          BCMGENET: Implement RX coalescing control knobs
remote:
remote:          Add support for the ethtool rx-frames coalescing parameter which allows
remote:          defining the number of RX interrupts per frames received. The RDMA
remote:          engine supports a configurable timeout with a resolution of
remote:          approximately 8.192 us.
remote:
remote:          We can no longer enable the BDONE/PDONE interrupts as those would
remote:          fire for each packet/buffer received, which would defeat the MBDONE
remote:          interrupt purpose. The MBDONE interrupt is guaranteed to correspond to a
remote:          PDONE/BDONE interrupt when the threshold is set to 1.

remote:          BCMGENET: Implement TX coalescing control knobs
remote:
remote:          Configuring the ethtool tx-frames property, which translates into N
remote:          packets before a TX interrupt is the simplest configuration scheme
remote:          because it requires no locking neither at the softare nor hardware
remote:          level, and is completely indepedent from the link speed. Since ethtool
remote:          does not allow per-tx queue coalescing parameters, we apply the same
remote:          setting to any transmit queue.
remote:
remote:          We can no longer enable the BDONE/PDONE interrupts as those would fire
remote:          for each packet/buffer received, which would defeat the MBDONE interrupt
remote:          purpose. The MBDONE interrupt is guaranteed to correspond to a
remote:          PDONE/BDONE interrupt when the threshold is set to 1, but offers
remote:          interrupt coalescing when the value is > 1.
remote:
remote:          Since the HW is configured to generate an interrupt when the ring
remote:          becomes emtpy, we have to deny any timeout/timer settings coming from
remote:          user-space to indicate we can only generate an interrupt very <N>
remote:          packets.
remote:
remote:          While we are at it, fix the DMA_INTR_THRESHOLD_MASK value which was off
remote:          by one bit (0xff vs. 0x1ff).

remote:          spi: brcmstb-mspi: remove unnecessary check for new params in spi_transfer
remote:
remote:          The speed, mode, and bits per word should never change in the middle of a
remote:          spi_transfer.  Checking for that in the loop within write_to_hw() was a
remote:          holdover from this function was called from transfer() in the dual bspi/mspi
remote:          driver, where it was necessary because that would handle multiple spi_transfers
remote:          at a time and it was important to know when to break.  Now that we're using
remote:          transfer_one(), remove the unnecessary test.
remote:
remote:          Also, it was misleading to have a function named ..._update_parms when calling
remote:          it one way was actually just a test that wouldn't actually update any
remote:          parameters.  Now it becomes a single-purpose function that fits its name.

remote:          spi: brcmstb-mspi: fix completion timeout
remote:
remote:          We had the timeout set as msecs_to_jiffies(10), and were seeing bad timeout
remote:          values.  Now, with CONFIG_HZ=100, a jiffy is ~10 ms, so msecs_to_jiffies(10)
remote:          ends up returning 1 jiffy.  Unfortunately, if I understand correctly, waiting
remote:          for a single jiffy isn't that effective, because it means you could be waiting
remote:          for basically no time at all, depending on when your operation is scheduled to
remote:          occur.  This matches up with what we were seeing, which is that when several
remote:          SPI writes were scheduled in sequence, it would consistently fail after several
remote:          ms, which suggests the following:
remote:
remote:          time
remote:           |
remote:           v                                       tick occurs
remote:           |
remote:           v        other things happen
remote:           |
remote:           v        SPI write starts
remote:           |
remote:           v        SPI write finishes
remote:           |
remote:           v        next SPI write starts
remote:           |                                       tick occurs
remote:           v        SPI write is considered to have timed out
remote:
remote:          Increase the timeout to 11 (which will be rounded up to 2 jiffies) seems to
remote:          make this problem go away entirely, which further supports this idea.  But
remote:          looking at a sampling of SPI bus drivers in drivers/spi/ suggests that it's
remote:          probably just best to set a larger timeout value, so let's set it to HZ (will
remote:          result in 1s timeout).

remote:          spi: Add Broadcom MSPI controller driver
remote:
remote:          Some comments that are NOT FOR UPSTREAM, explaining what was changed from
remote:          original spi-brcmstb driver:
remote:
remote:          - removes BSPI support (this should be made into a proper spi-nor framework
remote:            driver), which means we don't poke EBI CS anymore
remote:          - removes EBI CS switching, which is only needed for memory mapping
remote:          - add write lock field for use with BSPI
remote:          - use the BCM7120 L2 driver instead of twiddling L2 directly from here
remote:          - get rid of useless debug prints and unused fields
remote:          - use newer transfer_one spi core API
remote:          - use spi_transfer_is_last() instead of directly checking transfer_list
remote:          - remove unnecessary state and locking
remote:          - add timeout to wait_for_completion
remote:          - request mspi_done IRQ
remote:
remote:          Changes added by Gregory and Florian:
remote:
remote:          Until the spi-nor framework is used to allow using BSPI with this
remote:          driver, the spi-brcmstb driver, if enabled, should be used for HIF SPI
remote:          (MSPI+BSPI) instead.  This will then only be used when the compatible
remote:          string is "brcm,spi-brcmstb-mspi".

remote:          In case we parse the 'phy-mode' property, that is, of_get_phy_mode() returned
remote:          an error, we will take the "out" label, call mdiobus_unregister(), and then
remote:          return an error code. bcmgenet_mii_init() will take the "out" label as well and
remote:          call bcmgenet_mii_exit() calling bcmgenet_mii_free() which calls
remote:          mdiobus_unregister() a second time.
remote:
remote:          We would hit the BUG() condition on the mii_bus structure 'state' member and
remote:          crash the kernel.
remote:
remote:          Fix this by removing the mdiobus_unregister() call in
remote:          bcmgenet_mii_new_dt_init() since it duplicates the existing error path.

remote:          watchdog_dev: Change watchdog naming to be consistent with alias
remote:
remote:          There isn't a way to differentiate multiple watchdogs because
remote:          the naming scheme is done through watchdog_dev. This change uses
remote:          the alias ID for the watchdog name. This makes it easy to cross
remote:          reference the watchdog with the device tree alias so we can know
remote:          which watchdog we are using.
remote:
remote:          If no alias is defined, the watchdog will use the default naming
remote:          scheme.

remote:          ARM: v7 setup function should invalidate L1 cache
remote:
remote:          All ARMv5 and older CPUs invalidate their caches in the early assembly
remote:          setup function, prior to enabling the MMU.  This is because the L1
remote:          cache should not contain any data relevant to the execution of the
remote:          kernel at this point; all data should have been flushed out to memory.
remote:
remote:          This requirement should also be true for ARMv6 and ARMv7 CPUs - indeed,
remote:          these typically do not search their caches when caching is disabled (as
remote:          it needs to be when the MMU is disabled) so this change should be safe.
remote:
remote:          ARMv7 allows there to be CPUs which search their caches while caching is
remote:          disabled, and it's permitted that the cache is uninitialised at boot;
remote:          for these, the architecture reference manual requires that an
remote:          implementation specific code sequence is used immediately after reset
remote:          to ensure that the cache is placed into a sane state.  Such
remote:          functionality is definitely outside the remit of the Linux kernel, and
remote:          must be done by the SoC's firmware before _any_ CPU gets to the Linux
remote:          kernel.
remote:
remote:          Changing the data cache clean+invalidate to a mere invalidate allows us
remote:          to get rid of a lot of platform specific hacks around this issue for
remote:          their secondary CPU bringup paths - some of which were buggy.

remote:
remote:          The following were changes made by Brian during the upstream submission of the

remote:          - Add some more comments explaining what we have to do to bring down secondary
remote:            CPUs
remote:          - Get rid of some unnecessary tests

remote:            state and eliminating the dmb_sev(),
remote:          - Check in brcmstb_boot_secondary that we actually had the required DT nodes
remote:
remote:          (Yes, there's a typo in one of the comments, I'm keeping it to be consistent

remote:          mm: some brcmstb_get_page() cleanup
remote:
remote:          brcmstb_get_page() does not actually use its vma argument, so get rid of that.
remote:          We still need to check that we actually have a vma beforehand though.  Also,
remote:          the next_page label in __get_user_pages() (GUP) already handles accounting so we'd
remote:          like to just jump there and not duplicate the logic.  While looking at that, I
remote:          realized that we were unnecessarily re-finding the current vma every iteration,
remote:          which should only be necessary when first calling GUP or when crossing a vma
remote:          bound, so by changing to jump to next_page and instead also calling
remote:          brcmstb_get_page() in the inner loop, that should help to optimize GUP for BMEM
remote:          and CMA.

remote:          libata: skip debounce delay on link resume
remote:
remote:          The link resume logic uses a 200msec delay while debouncing
remote:          the SControl register. The rationale behind that delay is
remote:          to accomodate some PHYs that behave badly if their SStatus/
remote:          SControl registers are pounded immediately on resume.
remote:          The Broadcom STB SATA PHY does not seem to have this issue.
remote:          This patch introduces a new link flag that allows platforms
remote:          to skip the debounce delay if it isn't needed.

remote:          BCMGENET: enable MoCA link state change detection
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 8d88c6ebb34c3e54debe81e9b0d81b60411f8179]
remote:
remote:          Currently, MoCA fixed PHYs are always in link-up state, regardless of
remote:          whether the link is actually up or not.
remote:
remote:          Add code to properly detect MoCA link state changes and to reflect the
remote:          new state in MoCA fixed PHY. Only GENET V3 and V4 MACs are capable of
remote:          detecting MoCA link state changes.
remote:
remote:          The code works as follows:
remote:          1. GENET MAC detects MoCA link state change and issues UMAC_IRQ_LINK_UP
remote:             or UMAC_IRQ_LINK_DOWN interrupt.
remote:          2. Link up/down interrupt is processed in bcmgenet_irq_task(), which
remote:             calls phy_mac_interrupt().
remote:          3. phy_mac_interrupt() updates the fixed PHY phydev->link and kicks
remote:             the PHY state machine.
remote:          4. PHY state machine proceeds to read the fixed PHY link status
remote:             register.
remote:          5. When the fixed PHY link status register is being read, the new
remote:             function bcmgenet_fixed_phy_link_update() gets called. It copies
remote:             the fixed PHY phydev->link value to the fixed PHY status->link.
remote:          6. PHY state machine receives the new link state of the fixed PHY.
remote:          7. MoCA fixed PHY link state now correctly reflects the real MoCA
remote:             hardware link state.

remote:          without considering the power state of the particular port. The
remote:          AHCI specification isn't very clear on how to handle this scenario,
remote:          leaving implementation open to interpretation.
remote:
remote:          Broadcom's STB SATA host controller is unable to handle port DMA
remote:          controller restarts when the port in question is in low power mode.
remote:          When a port enters partial or slumber mode, it's PHY is powered down.
remote:          When a controller restart is requested, the controller's internal
remote:          state machine expects the PHY to be brought back up by software which
remote:          never happens in this case, resulting in failures.
remote:
remote:          To avoid this situation, logic is added to manually wake up the port
remote:          just before it's DMA engine is stopped, if the port happens to be in
remote:          a low power state. HBA initiated power management ensures that the port
remote:          eventually returns to it's configured low power state, when the link is
remote:          idle (as per the conditions listed in the spec). A new host flag is also
remote:          added to ensure this logic is only exercised for hosts with the above
remote:          limitation.

remote:          soc: brcmstb: wktmr: Implement persistent clock for sleep
remote:
remote:          In order to have the core kernel timekeeping code to work and be able to
remote:          account for time spent during sleep states, implement a persistent clock device
remote:          which utilizes the WKTMR.
remote:
remote:          ARM offers the ability to dynamically register such a device using
remote:          register_persistent_clock(), so we utilize this to provide a working
remote:          implementation.
remote:
remote:          While at it, fix the typo on the prescaler register define.
remote:
remote:          Note that the wktmr is now a singleton, and we will return -EBUSY if we find an
remote:          existing wake-timer instance while probing.

remote:          irqchip: bcm7120-l2: Fix interrupt status reads for multiple L1
remote:
remote:          Our irq-bcm7120-l2 interrupt controller driver utilizes the same handler
remote:          function for the different parent interrupts it services: UPG_MAIN, UPG_BSC for
remote:          instance.
remote:
remote:          The problem is that function reads the IRQSTAT register which can combine
remote:          interrupt causes for different parent interrupts, such that we can end-up in the
remote:          following situation:
remote:
remote:          - CPU takes an interrupt
remote:          - bcm7120_l2_intc_irq_handle() reads IRQSTAT
remote:          - generic_handle_irq() is invoked
remote:          - there are still pending interrupts flagged in IRQSTAT from a different parent
remote:          - handle_bad_irq() is invoked
remote:
remote:          In order to fix this, make sure that we always mask IRQSTAT with the
remote:          appropriate bits that correspond go the parent interrupt source this is coming
remote:          from. To simplify things, associate an unique structure per parent interrupt
remote:          handler to avoid multiplying the number of lookups.
remote:
remote:          While at it, remove the unused 'gc' argument from bcm7120_l2_intc_irq_handle().

remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit f668f074ff58dea540d83bbed1b2c1171b0dd764]
remote:
remote:          This check may be prone to race conditions, e.g.
remote:
remote:          1) Some external event (e.g. GPIO level) causes an IRQ to become pending
remote:          2) Peripheral asserts the L2 IRQ
remote:          3) CPU takes an interrupt
remote:          4) The event from #1 goes away
remote:          5) bcm7120_l2_intc_irq_handle() reads back a 0 status
remote:
remote:          Unlike the hardware supported by brcmstb-l2, the bcm7120-l2 controller
remote:          does not latch the IRQ status.  Bits can change if the inputs to the
remote:          controller change.  Also, do_bad_IRQ() is an ARM-specific macro.
remote:
remote:          So let's just nuke it.

remote:          BCMGENET: Remove excessive PHY reset
remote:
remote:          We are currently issuing multiple PHY resets during a suspend/resume,
remote:          first during bcmgenet_power_up() which does a hardware reset, then a
remote:          software reset by calling bcmgenet_mii_reset(). This is both unnecessary
remote:          and can take as long as 10ms per MDIO transactions while we re-apply
remote:          workarounds because we do not yet have MDIO interrupts enabled.
remote:
remote:          phy_resume() takes care of re-apply our workarounds in case we need any,
remote:          and bcmgenet_power_up() does a PHY hardware reset, all of this is more
remote:          than enough to guarantee that the PHY operates correctly.

remote:          mmc: Some Micron eMMC devices cause reboot to hang
remote:
remote:          When using eMMC as the boot device, some Micron eMMC devices will
remote:          cause reboot to hang. This is a result of the eMMC device not going
remote:          into boot mode after the hardware sends CMD0 to reset the eMMC
remote:          device. This only happens if the kernel driver sends CMD5 (SLEEP_WAKE),
remote:          to put the device into sleep state, before restarting the system.
remote:          The fix is to add a quirk that avoids sending the SLEEP command
remote:          and to use MMC_FIXUP to set the quirk for these Micron devices.

remote:
remote:          All BCM7xxx integrated Gigabit PHYs have an issue in their MDIO
remote:          management controller which will make the initial read or write to them
remote:          to fail and return 0xffff. This is a real issue as the typical first
remote:          thing we do is read from MII_PHYSID1 and MII_PHYSID2 from get_phy_id()
remote:          to register a driver for these PHYs.
remote:
remote:          Coupled with the workaround in drivers/net/phy/bcm7xxx.c, this
remote:          workaround for the MDIO bus controller consists in scanning the list of
remote:          PHYs to do this initial read workaround for as part of the MDIO bus
remote:          reset routine which is invoked prior to mdiobus_scan().
remote:
remote:          Once we have a proper PHY driver/device registered, all workarounds are

remote:          usb: BDC: Configure Host/Device mode port sharing based on DT
remote:
remote:          The "device" property in the ""brcm,usb-instance" node will
remote:          specify how a port will be shared between USB Host and Device
remote:          controllers. "off" will will be host only, "on" will be device
remote:          only and "dual" will be the DRD (Dual Role Device) mode.
remote:          This property will be used by the USB wrapper driver to configure
remote:          the USB ctrl registers properly.
remote:          NOTES:
remote:          - "dual" mode is broken on the 7439bx but will be fixed in
remote:            future chips.
remote:          - The combination of enabled DT nodes for ohci ehic xhci and bdc
remote:            are expected to be correct for the chosen mode.

remote:          soc: brcmstb: memory: fix up default reserve alignment
remote:
remote:          When moving the default reservation logic, I accidentally left out a
remote:          crucial change for the 512M DRAM case: alignment fixing.  While this
remote:          should _hopefully_ only be required for 512M, we actually want to be
remote:          pageblock-aligned all the time (well, it's not pageblock for transparent
remote:          hugepages, but it's easier to just say pageblock), and it's certainly
remote:          possible that some memory reservations might not be so aligned.  So just
remote:          do the alignment all of the time like we were doing in cma_driver
remote:          before.
remote:
remote:          Tested on 73649a0 (512M RAM) that default boot-time CMA reserve works
remote:          and 'cmatool unittest' passes all tests after this change.

remote:          net: dsa: bcm_sf2: do not use indirect reads and writes for 7445E0
remote:
remote:          7445E0 contains an ECO (HW7445-1526) which disconnected the internal SF2
remote:          pseudo-PHY which was known to conflict with the external pseudo-PHY of
remote:          BCM53125 switches. This motivated the need to utilize the internal SF2
remote:          MDIO controller via indirect register reads/writes to control external
remote:          Broadcom switches due to this address conflict (both responded at
remote:          address 30d).
remote:
remote:          For 7445E0, the internal pseudo-PHY of the SF2 switch got disconnected,
remote:          and as a consequence this prevents the internal SF2 MDIO bus controller
remote:          from reading data (reads back everything as 0) since the MDI line is
remote:          tied low.
remote:
remote:          Fix this by making the indirect register reads and writes conditional to
remote:          7445D0, on 7445E0 we can utilize the SWITCH_MDIO controller (backed by
remote:          mdio-unimac and not the DSA created slave MII bus).

remote:          Specifying any brcm_cma or bmem parameter on the kernel boot line will result
remote:          in the selected default being overridden with manual reservations.
remote:

remote:          Recently, Bolt began adding optionally the "dma-ranges" property
remote:          to the PCIe nodes.  This property instructs Linux how to massage

remote:          use with PCIe drivers.  Currently, this Linux functionality is
remote:          a WIP so just issue a warning for now when we see the property.

remote:          gpio: brcmstb: support wakeup from S5 cold boot
remote:
remote:          For wake from S5, we need to:
remote:          - register a reboot handler
remote:          - set wakeup capability before requesting IRQ so wakeup count is incremented
remote:          - mask all GPIO IRQs and clear any pending interrupts during driver probe to
remote:            since no driver will yet be registered to handle any IRQs carried over from
remote:            boot at that time, and it's possible that the booted kernel does not request
remote:            the same IRQ anyway.
remote:
remote:          This means that /sys/.../power/wakeup_count is valid at boot time,
remote:          and we can properly account for S5 wakeup stats. e.g.:
remote:
remote:            ### After waking from S5 from a GPIO key
remote:            # cat /sys/bus/platform/drivers/brcmstb-gpio/f04172c0.gpio/power/wakeup

remote:          gpio: brcmstb: switch to using gpiolib irqchip helpers
remote:
remote:          Switches the BRCMSTB UPG GIO driver to using the gpiolib irqchip helpers
remote:          in the gpiolib core.  This lets us reduce the amount of duplicated code
remote:          a bit.  For this to work, the irq setup function is changed to be called
remote:          once per bank instead of once per device.
remote:
remote:          What wasn't obvious to me before: you can have multiple chained irqchips
remote:          and associated IRQ domains for a single parent IRQ, and as long as the
remote:          xlate function is written correctly, a GPIO IRQ request end up checking
remote:          the correct domain and will get associated with the correct IRQ.  What
remote:          helps make this clear is to read
remote:            drivers/gpio/gpiolib-of.c:
remote:             - of_gpiochip_find_and_xlate()
remote:             - of_get_named_gpiod_flags()
remote:            drivers/gpio/gpiolib.c:

remote:          after allocating the priv struct to both avoid the null pointer dereference
remote:          that could occur today.  To guard against potential future changes, check for

remote:          [Upstream commit e45d1c80c0eee88e82751461e9cac49d9ed287bc]
remote:
remote:          Another feature that is duplicated in a number of GPIO irqchips
remote:          is that these cascades IRQs are assigned their own lock class
remote:          so as to avoid warnings about lockdep recursions. Do this also
remote:          in the generic GPIO irqchip helpers for smooth transition to
remote:          this core infrastructure.

remote:          gpio: support threaded interrupts in irqchip helpers
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 1c8732bb0355b929b09173464cdca7df4d516f89]
remote:
remote:          Some off-chip GPIO expanders need to be communicated by I2C or
remote:          SPI traffic, but may still support IRQs. By the sleeping nature
remote:          of such buses, such IRQ handlers need to be threaded. Support
remote:          such handlers in the gpiochip irqchip helpers by flagging IRQs
remote:          as threaded if the .can_sleep property of the gpiochip is
remote:          true.
remote:
remote:          Helpfully deny registration of chained IRQ handlers if the
remote:          .can_sleep property is set, as such chips will invariably need
remote:          a nested handler rather than a chained handler.

remote:
remote:          During irq mapping, in irq_set_chip_and_handler() the process

remote:          gpio: add IRQ chip helpers in gpiolib
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 1425052097b53de841e064dc190a9009480c208c]
remote:
remote:          This provides a function gpiochip_irqchip_add() to set
remote:          up an irqchip for a GPIO controller, and a function
remote:          gpiochip_set_chained_irqchip() to chain it to a parent
remote:          irqchip.
remote:
remote:          Most GPIOs are of the type where a number of lines form
remote:          a cascaded interrupt controller chained onto
remote:          the primary system interrupt controller (or further down the
remote:          chain) so let's add this helper and factor the code to
remote:          request the lines to be used as IRQs, the .to_irq() function
remote:          and the irqdomain into the core as well.

remote:          genirq: Provide irq_request/release_resources chip callbacks
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit f438acdf3de8f19ad2789eddbf52e3280292759b]
remote:
remote:          For certain irq types, e.g. gpios, it's necessary to request resources
remote:          before starting up the irq.
remote:
remote:          This might fail so we cannot use the irq_startup() callback because we
remote:          might call the irq_set_type() callback before that which does not make
remote:          sense when the resource is not available. Calling irq_startup() before
remote:          irq_set_type() can lead to spurious interrupts which is not desired
remote:          either.

remote:          gpiolib: Allow GPIO chips to request their own GPIOs
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 77c2d7929d7d7f0e391b17f85d2d954912ed0590]
remote:
remote:          Sometimes it is useful to allow GPIO chips themselves to request GPIOs they
remote:          own through gpiolib API. One use case is ACPI ASL code that should be able
remote:          to toggle GPIOs through GPIO operation regions.
remote:
remote:          We can't use gpio_request() because it will pin the module to the kernel
remote:          forever (it calls try_module_get()). To solve this we move module refcount
remote:          manipulation to gpiod_request() and let __gpiod_request() handle the actual
remote:          request. This changes the sequence a bit as now try_module_get() is called
remote:          outside of gpio_lock (I think this is safe, try_module_get() handles
remote:          serialization it needs already).
remote:
remote:          Then we provide gpiolib internal functions gpiochip_request/free_own_desc()
remote:          that do the same as gpio_request() but don't manipulate module refrence
remote:          count. This allows the GPIO chip driver to request and free descriptors it
remote:          owns without being pinned to the kernel forever.

remote:          gpiolib: add gpiochip_get_desc() driver function
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit bb1e88ccb771492ac908ac295ec135efa1d53093]
remote:
remote:          Some drivers dealing with a gpio_chip might need to act on its
remote:          descriptors directly; one example is pinctrl drivers that need to lock a
remote:          GPIO for being used as IRQ using gpiod_lock_as_irq().
remote:
remote:          This patch exports a gpiochip_get_desc() function that returns the
remote:          GPIO descriptor at the requested index. It also sweeps the
remote:          gpio_to_chip() function out of the consumer interface since any holder
remote:          of a gpio_chip reference can manipulate its GPIOs way beyond what a
remote:          consumer should be allowed to do.
remote:
remote:          As a result, gpio_chip is not visible anymore to simple GPIO consumers.

remote:          soc: brcmstb: Add memory API for middleware
remote:
remote:          Adds a way for the Broadcom middleware (nexus) to be able to get the
remote:          information it needs about how memory is placed on the system.  This is done by
remote:          the ability to populate a struct brcmstb_memory with info on
remote:          - PA ranges for each memory controller
remote:          - static "bmem" ranges
remote:          - dynamic (CMA in this case) reserved ranges
remote:          - reserved areas unavailable to middleware
remote:
remote:          We use libfdt to read the device tree for info on what memory should actually
remote:          be visible.
remote:
remote:          Moves phys_addr_to_memc from cma_driver to memory API and renames as
remote:          brcmstb_memory_phys_addr_to_memc, since it is now shared by cma_driver and this
remote:          code.
remote:
remote:          This also adds to the platform reserve code in order to grab the memblock

remote:
remote:          Changes include:
remote:
remote:          - Place in drivers/soc/brcmstb
remote:          - Use new Kconfig entry to enable: CONFIG_BRCMSTB_BMEM
remote:          - No default allocation (must specify everything manually).
remote:          - Does not assume that address 0 means "put at end of memc0".  It'll put the
remote:            reserved regions wherever you want.
remote:          - No safeties: you can reserve all of lowmem if you want to watch the kernel
remote:            crash and burn.
remote:          - No special handling for memc1: not needed since we're not overriding the
remote:            default free_bootmem like on mips, but rather providing a saner means via
remote:            bmem_reserve which uses memblock and will be called from arch code.
remote:          - MAX_BMEM_REGIONS bumped from 4 to 8.
remote:          - Uses phys_addr_t instead of unsigned long so we can use >32-bit addresses
remote:            where appropriate.
remote:          - Don't BUG on pud_none in bmem_get_page because we've seen this unnecessarily
remote:            crashes the kernel on ARM when called from GUP (see SWLINUX-3350)
remote:          - Use phys_addr_t for bmem functions

remote:

remote:          BCMSYSPORT: rewrite bcm_sysport_rx_refill
remote:
remote:          Currently, bcm_sysport_desc_rx() calls bcm_sysport_rx_refill() at the end of Rx
remote:          packet processing loop, after the current Rx packet has already been passed to
remote:          napi_gro_receive(). However, bcm_sysport_rx_refill() might fail to allocate a new
remote:          Rx skb, thus leaving a hole on the Rx queue where no valid Rx buffer exists.
remote:
remote:          To eliminate this situation:
remote:
remote:          1. Rewrite bcm_sysport_rx_refill() to retain the current Rx skb on the
remote:          Rx queue if a new replacement Rx skb can't be allocated and DMA-mapped.
remote:          In this case, the data on the current Rx skb is effectively dropped.
remote:
remote:          2. Modify bcm_sysport_desc_rx() to call bcm_sysport_rx_refill() at the
remote:          top of Rx packet processing loop, so that the new replacement Rx skb is
remote:          already in place before the current Rx skb is processed.
remote:
remote:          This is loosely inspired from d6707bec5986 ("net: bcmgenet: rewrite
remote:          bcmgenet_rx_refill()")

remote:          gpio: clamp returned values to the boolean range
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 23600969ff137cf4c3bc9098f77e381de334e3f7]
remote:
remote:          Nothing prevents GPIO drivers from returning values outside the
remote:          boolean range, and as it turns out a few drivers are actually doing so.
remote:          These values were passed as-is to unsuspecting consumers and created
remote:          confusion.
remote:
remote:          This patch makes the internal _gpiod_get_raw_value() function return a
remote:          bool, effectively clamping the GPIO value to the boolean range no
remote:          matter what the driver does.
remote:
remote:          While we are at it, we also change the value parameter of
remote:          _gpiod_set_raw_value() to bool type before drivers start doing funny
remote:          things with it as well.
remote:
remote:          Another way to fix this would be to change the prototypes of the driver
remote:          interface to use bool directly, but this would require a huge
remote:          cross-systems patch so this simpler solution is preferred.
remote:
remote:          Changes since v1:
remote:          - Change local variable type to bool as well, use boolean values in
remote:            code
remote:          - Also change prototype of open drain/open source setting functions
remote:            since they are only called from _gpiod_set_raw_value()
remote:
remote:          This probably calls for a larger booleanization of gpiolib, but let's
remote:          keep that for a latter change - right now we need to address the issue
remote:          of non-boolean values returned by drivers.

remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 3be2a49e5c08d268f8af0dd4fe89a24ea8cdc339]
remote:
remote:          Some Ethernet MACs have a "fixed link", and are not connected to a
remote:          normal MDIO-managed PHY device. For those situations, a Device Tree
remote:          binding allows to describe a "fixed link" using a special PHY node.
remote:
remote:          This patch adds:
remote:
remote:           * A documentation for the fixed PHY Device Tree binding.
remote:
remote:           * An of_phy_is_fixed_link() function that an Ethernet driver can call
remote:             on its PHY phandle to find out whether it's a fixed link PHY or
remote:             not. It should typically be used to know if
remote:             of_phy_register_fixed_link() should be called.
remote:
remote:           * An of_phy_register_fixed_link() function that instantiates the
remote:             fixed PHY into the PHY subsystem, so that when the driver calls
remote:             of_phy_connect(), the PHY device associated to the OF node will be
remote:             found.
remote:
remote:          These two additional functions also support the old fixed-link Device
remote:          Tree binding used on PowerPC platforms, so that ultimately, the
remote:          network device drivers for those platforms could be converted to use
remote:          of_phy_is_fixed_link() and of_phy_register_fixed_link() instead of
remote:          of_phy_connect_fixed_link(), while keeping compatibility with their
remote:          respective Device Tree bindings.

remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit a75951217472c522c324adb0a4de3ba69d656ef5]
remote:
remote:          The existing fixed_phy_add() function has several drawbacks that
remote:          prevents it from being used as is for OF-based declaration of fixed
remote:          PHYs:
remote:
remote:           * The address of the PHY on the fake bus needs to be passed, while a
remote:             dynamic allocation is desired.
remote:
remote:           * Since the phy_device instantiation is post-poned until the next
remote:             mdiobus scan, there is no way to associate the fixed PHY with its
remote:             OF node, which later prevents of_phy_connect() from finding this
remote:             fixed PHY from a given OF node.
remote:
remote:          To solve this, this commit introduces fixed_phy_register(), which will
remote:          allocate an available PHY address, add the PHY using fixed_phy_add()
remote:          and instantiate the phy_device structure associated with the provided
remote:          OF node.

remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 9b744942290c168287013f0a19ff7392f65c8107]
remote:
remote:          Until now, the fixed_phy_add() function was taking as argument
remote:          'phy_id', which was used both as the PHY address on the fake fixed
remote:          MDIO bus, and as the PHY id, as available in the MII_PHYSID1 and
remote:          MII_PHYSID2 registers. However, those two informations are completely
remote:          unrelated.
remote:
remote:          This patch decouples them. The PHY id of fixed PHYs is hardcoded to be
remote:          0x0. Ideally, a really reserved value would be nicer, but there
remote:          doesn't seem to be an easy of making sure a dummy value can be
remote:          assigned to the Linux kernel for such usage.
remote:
remote:          The PHY address remains passed by the caller of phy_fixed_add().

remote:          net: dsa: bcm_sf2: propagate carrier down states
remote:
remote:          There is currently a complex race condition with fixed PHYs utilizing a
remote:          link_update callback in how they propagate link down notifications. We may, or
remote:          may not, under certain circumstances reach the PHY_NOLINK state in the PHY state
remote:          machine, which means that we will never call netif_carrier_off() for that
remote:          interface. This is a problem for link monitoring applications since they will
remote:          never learn about the "NO-CARRIER" flag.
remote:
remote:          Fix that by explicitly calling netif_carrier_off() in our link_update callback
remote:          to propagate carrier state changes accordingly.

remote:          gpio: Add GPIO support for Broadcom STB SoCs
remote:
remote:          This adds support for the GPIO IP "UPG GIO" used on Broadcom STB SoCs
remote:          (BCM7XXX and some others).  Uses basic_mmio_gpio to instantiate a
remote:          gpio_chip for each bank.  The driver assumes that it handles the base
remote:          set of GPIOs on the system and that it can start its numbering sequence
remote:          from 0, so any GPIO expanders used with it must dynamically assign GPIO
remote:          numbers after this driver has finished registering its GPIOs.
remote:
remote:          Does not implement the interrupt-controller portion yet, will be done in a
remote:          future commit.

remote:          thermal: brcmstb_thermal: add of-thermal and hardware trigger support
remote:
remote:          We can make use of the upstream thermal device tree bindings to
remote:          configure trip points for us. We can also make use of the proposed
remote:          .set_trips() callback, which was backported in a previous patch (not
remote:          upstream yet) to utilize our high/low interrupts most economically.
remote:
remote:          Because we supplied some basic support for temperature readins
remote:          previously, where this driver registered its own standalone thermal zone
remote:          (without using the of-thermal framework), I have migrated the existing
remote:          support into a fall-back 'brcmstb_thermal_zone_probe()' option. This
remote:          can help transition between device trees that have the 'thermal-zones'
remote:          node set up and those that don't. We should schedule this to be removed
remote:          quickly in a future release.

remote:          useful to provide this information in the uevent metadata. That way, a
remote:          user-space governor can figure out this information directly, without
remote:          any guessing. This also eliminates a potential race, where the
remote:          temperature may have changed between the time a hardware trip was fired
remote:          and the time it is received by the governor.
remote:
remote:          This patch should be submitted upstream. It's possible this will not
remote:          suit the general needs of other thermal users, and so we might consider
remote:          integrating this directly into brcmstb_thermal instead.

remote:          thermal: report trips only when crossed
remote:
remote:          For some reason, the existing infrastructure will notify *all* trip
remote:          points whenever any driver calls thermal_zone_device_update_temp(). This
remote:          is unfortunate for users of hardware-backed trip points, since that
remote:          means we lose all information about which trip point triggered the
remote:          update, if any.
remote:
remote:          Instead, let's only call handle_thermal_trip() when we've crossed a
remote:          trip.
remote:
remote:          This should be submitted upstream, possibly with some rework to make it
remote:          more generically useful. If nothing else, it might generate some
remote:          explanation as to why the trip point notifications are currently so
remote:          peculiar, as described above.

remote:          thermal: add thermal_zone_device_update_temp() API
remote:
remote:          Allow drivers to report a particular update temperature.
remote:
remote:          This is important for hardware-supported trip points. On such hardware,
remote:          there is a potential for inconstency in the following sequence:
remote:
remote:          (1) hardware interrupt
remote:          (2) themal_zone_device_update(),
remote:          (3) zone->get_temp()
remote:
remote:          Between (1) and (3), the temperature might change a bit.
remote:
remote:          So, rather than add in caching to the sensor driver to record the
remote:          temperature at (1), just allow the driver to pass it directly through.
remote:
remote:          This should be submitted upstream.

remote:          thermal: Add support for hardware-tracked trip points
remote:
remote:          [Backported preliminary patch. See thread:
remote:          http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.power-management.general/58483/]
remote:
remote:          This adds support for hardware-tracked trip points to the device tree
remote:          thermal sensor framework.
remote:
remote:          The framework supports an arbitrary number of trip points. Whenever
remote:          the current temperature is updated, the trip points immediately
remote:          below and above the current temperature are found. A .set_trips
remote:          callback is then called with the temperatures. If there is no trip
remote:          point above or below the current temperature, the passed trip
remote:          temperature will be ULONG_MAX or 0 respectively. In this callback,
remote:          the driver should program the hardware such that it is notified
remote:          when either of these trip points are triggered. When a trip point
remote:          is triggered, the driver should call `thermal_zone_device_update'
remote:          for the respective thermal zone. This will cause the trip points
remote:          to be updated again.
remote:
remote:          If .set_trips is not implemented, the framework behaves as before.
remote:
remote:          This patch is based on an earlier version from Mikko Perttunen

remote:

remote:          http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.power-management.general/58483/]
remote:
remote:          The thermal core uses the existence of the .get_temp, .get_trend and
remote:          .set_emul_temp to detect whether this operation exists and should be
remote:          used or whether it should be emulated in software. This makes problems
remote:          for of-thermal which has to modify the struct thermal_zone_device_ops
remote:          during runtime whenever a sensor is registered or unregistered.
remote:
remote:          Let the core test for -ENOSYS from these callbacks and treat it like
remote:          if the callbacks were not present.
remote:
remote:          This allows of-thermal to always set the sensor related callbacks and
remote:          to make struct thermal_zone_device_ops const again.

remote:
remote:          [Backported preliminary patch. See thread:
remote:          http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.power-management.general/58483/]
remote:
remote:          commit e6e238c38 (thermal: sysfs: Add a new sysfs node emul_temp for
remote:          thermal emulation)  promised not to emulate critical temperatures,
remote:          but the check for critical temperatures is broken in multiple ways:
remote:
remote:          - The code should only accept an emulated temperature when the emulated
remote:            temperature is lower than the critical temperature. Instead the code
remote:            accepts an emulated temperature whenever the real temperature is lower
remote:            than the critical temperature. This makes no sense and trying to
remote:            emulate a temperature higher than the critical temperature halts the
remote:            system.
remote:          - When trying to emulate a higher-than-critical temperature we should either
remote:            limit the emulated temperature to the maximum non critical temperature
remote:            or refuse to emulate this temperature. Instead the code just silently
remote:            ignores the emulated temperature and continues with the real temperature.
remote:
remote:          This patch moves the test for illegal emulated temperature to the sysfs
remote:          write function so that we can properly refuse illegal temperatures here.
remote:          Trying to write illegal temperatures results in an error message. While
remote:          at it use IS_ENABLED() instead of #ifdefs.

remote:          thermal: Fix cdev registration with THERMAL_NO_LIMIT on 64bit
remote:
remote:          The size of unsigned long varies between 32 and 64 bit systems while
remote:          the size of phandle arguments is always 32 bits per parameter.
remote:
remote:          On 64-bit systems, cooling devices registered via of-thermal apis fail
remote:          to bind when the min/max cooling state is specified as
remote:          THERMAL_NO_LIMIT (-1UL) as there is a mis-match between the value read
remote:          from the device tree (32bit) and the pre-processor define (64bit).
remote:
remote:          As we're unlikely to need cooling states larger than 32 bits, and for
remote:          consistency with the size of phandle arguments, explicitly limit
remote:          THERMAL_NO_LIMIT to 32 bits.

remote:          thermal: of: improve of-thermal sensor registration API
remote:
remote:          Different drivers request API extensions in of-thermal. For this reason,
remote:          additional callbacks are required to fit the new drivers needs.
remote:
remote:          The current API implementation expects the registering sensor driver
remote:          to provide a get_temp and get_trend callbacks as function parameters.
remote:          As the amount of callbacks is growing, this patch changes the existing
remote:          implementation to use a .ops field to hold all the of thermal callbacks
remote:          to sensor drivers.
remote:
remote:          This patch also changes the existing of-thermal users to fit the new
remote:          API design. No functional change is introduced in this patch.

remote:          thermal: add support to disable thermal zone from DTS
remote:
remote:          Add support to check status of the thermal zone before registering the
remote:          zone. This will help on disabling some non-existing thermal zone from
remote:          the top level DTS file out of common dtsi thermalzone file.
remote:
remote:          For example,
remote:          we have 3 platforms almost same but thermal zones on this platform are
remote:          little bit different. Platform 1 and 2 have three thermal zones and
remote:          platform 3 has two thermal zones. To avoid duplication of the thermal
remote:          zones entries on each DTS file of platforms,we created one common
remote:          dtsi file for thermal zone and included this dtsi file from these
remote:          3 platform's top level dts file.
remote:
remote:          On common thermal zone com dtsi file, all thermal zone are enabled and
remote:          need to disable one of thermal zone on platform 3 dts file. For this, we
remote:          just added entry status = "disabled" for that thermal zone on platform 3
remote:          dts file and along with this change to make it work.
remote:
remote:          This way, we reuse the common file and control the enable/disable of the
remote:          thermal zone from top level dts file.

remote:          clk: divider: handle integer overflow when dividing large clock rates
remote:
remote:          [Backported version of patch from:
remote:          http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.power-management.general/59004
remote:          Some discussion at:
remote:          lkml.kernel.org/g/20150413201433.GQ32500@ld-irv-0074]
remote:
remote:          On 32-bit architectures, 'unsigned long' (the type used to hold clock
remote:          rates, in Hz) is often only 32 bits wide. DIV_ROUND_UP() (as used in,
remote:          e.g., commit b11d282dbea2 "clk: divider: fix rate calculation for
remote:          fractional rates") can yield an integer overflow on clock rates that are
remote:          not (by themselves) too large to fit in 32 bits, because it performs
remote:          addition before the division. See for example:
remote:
remote:            DIV_ROUND_UP(3000000000, 1500000000) = (3.0G + 1.5G - 1) / 1.5G
remote:                                                 = OVERFLOW / 1.5G
remote:
remote:          This patch fixes such cases by always promoting the dividend to 64-bits
remote:          (unsigned long long) before doing the division. While this patch does
remote:          not resolve the issue with large clock rates across the common clock
remote:          framework nor address the problems with doing full 64-bit arithmetic on
remote:          a 32-bit architecture, it does fix some issues seen when using clock
remote:          dividers on a 3GHz reference clock to produce a 1.5GHz CPU clock for an
remote:          ARMv7 Brahma B15 SoC.

remote:          clk: clk-divider: pass width to _register_divider()
remote:
remote:          _register_divider() expects a mask width parameter, not the mask itself.
remote:
remote:          Also add extra sanity checking on the device tree, since we really
remote:          expect a contiguous mask, packed to the low bit position.
remote:
remote:          Note that the code in question has not been merged upstream; the
remote:          original code was just grabbed off the mailing list.
remote:
remote:          Perhaps for an upstream submission, this property should be reworked as
remote:          a 'mask-width' parameter instead? It's not clear to me what we would do
remote:          with a non-contiguous mask, as this binding (and driver) was not really
remote:          designed for it. And I don't think such hardware exists, at least not in
remote:          a sane world.

remote:          ARM: brcmstb: initialize SMP ops with CPU_METHOD_OF_DECLARE() helpers
remote:
remote:          This allows the DT initialization framework to dynamically match our CPU
remote:          SMP code with the hardware it should be used on based on the DTB, rather
remote:          than statically determining that in our machine description file. This
remote:          enables the use of PSCI, for instance.
remote:
remote:          While doing this, let's move the code out into a separate mini driver,
remote:          so we can get all the SMP/hotplug code in one place, and to match
remote:          upstream.

remote:          ARM: Introduce CPU_METHOD_OF_DECLARE() for cpu hotplug/smp
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 6c3ff8b11a16ec69199ab85b74a5fae6d9c59db7]
remote:
remote:          The goal of multi-platform kernels is to remove the need for mach
remote:          directories and machine descriptors. To further that goal,
remote:          introduce CPU_METHOD_OF_DECLARE() to allow cpu hotplug/smp
remote:          support to be separated from the machine descriptors.
remote:          Implementers should specify an enable-method property in their
remote:          cpus node and then implement a matching set of smp_ops in their
remote:          hotplug/smp code, wiring it up with the CPU_METHOD_OF_DECLARE()
remote:          macro. When the kernel is compiled we'll collect all the
remote:          enable-method smp_ops into one section for use at boot.
remote:
remote:          At boot time we'll look for an enable-method in each cpu node and
remote:          try to match that against all known CPU enable methods in the
remote:          kernel. If there are no enable-methods in the cpu nodes we
remote:          fallback to the cpus node and try to use any enable-method found
remote:          there. If that doesn't work we fall back to the old way of using
remote:          the machine descriptor.

remote:
remote:          If we can find a "brcm,write-pairing" boolean property in Device Tree, enable

remote:
remote:          For Device Tree that do not have this property, the behavior is unchanged, and
remote:          we keep disabling MCP write-pairing.
remote:
remote:          Newer chips which have working MCP write-pairing are expected to place this
remote:          property in the hif_cpubiuctrl node to indicate this.

remote:
remote:          [Upstream submission: https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/4/8/754 ]
remote:
remote:          get_symbol_str() was assuming that symbols would only have a single

remote:          This is not true, and one current example is FRAME_POINTER which is

remote:          ARM: mmu: Bump default vmalloc to 744 MiB for BRCMSTB with >=1 GiB RAM
remote:
remote:          If >= 1 GiB RAM is present (or more than one meminfo bank exists), this
remote:          increases the vmalloc area to 744 MiB and thus reduces the default amount of
remote:          lowmem to 256 MiB, which is basically all we were getting anyway with
remote:          cma_driver putting all other memory in CMA regions.  This should eliminate what
remote:          has been referred to as the "CMA barrier" (the split in memory regions on the
remote:          first memory controller because of the lowmem/highmem boundary) without
remote:          negatively impacting the actual amount of memory on the system (kernel
remote:          allocations mostly couldn't use lowmem in CMA regions anyway).
remote:
remote:          It'd be nice if we could just have more lowmem so as not to help alleviate
remote:          lowmem exhaustion, but that's a problem for another day.
remote:
remote:          For systems with < 1GB RAM, there was no CMA barrier, so we keep the default
remote:          vmalloc size the same.
remote:
remote:          This will probably need updating if there are ever any boards with 768 MiB RAM.
remote:          Also, the function relies on meminfo so will need to be updated for 3.16+, which
remote:          no longer uses meminfo.

remote:          pci: dynamically allocate brcm_pcie structure
remote:
remote:          Before we kept a statically array of two PCIe structures which
remote:          seemed enough at the time.  With this commit we keep the array,
remote:          but make it an array of pointers that will contain dynmically
remote:          allocated PCIe structures.  In a future commit we will dispose
remote:          of the array entirely and use a list.
remote:
remote:          In the process of making this change, we initialize the
remote:          hw_data.private_data structure so that it points to an array
remote:          of our PCIe pointers.  As such, we can use the pci_sys_data
remote:          structure to recover the PCIe pointer of interest.  This
remote:          obsoletes the awkward bus range counting that was done for
remote:          each RC.

remote:          pci: change use of 'bus' to be 'pcie'
remote:
remote:          Since this file existed for MIPs SOCs, the use of the term
remote:          'bus' in this file has been a misnomer.  This commit corrects
remote:          this.  Specifically, 'struct brcm_pci_bus *' is now
remote:          'struct brcm_pcie *', and the variables of this type that were

remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 803dd9c77ac3a08958535f2a1ad5890104e2c235]
remote:
remote:          As part of a call to ndo_close() a netdevice driver may call
remote:          phy_disconnect() -> phy_detach() -> phy_suspend(), such that the PHY is
remote:          suspsended at this point and a netdevice driver may clock gate the
remote:          backing peripheral providing MDIO bus accessses as well.
remote:
remote:          Update mdio_bus_phy_may_suspend() to return whether a PHY is allowed to
remote:          be suspended and conversely resumed if and only if it was not previously
remote:          suspended before while it is currently in detached (netdev pointer is
remote:          NULL) state.
remote:
remote:          This fixes bus errors seen during S2/S3 suspend/resume cycles for
remote:          netdevice drivers such as GENET which clock gates the entire Ethernet
remote:          MAC, including the MDIO bus block.

remote:          PM / sleep: add configurable delay for pm_test
remote:
remote:          [Queued upstream]
remote:
remote:          When CONFIG_PM_DEBUG=y, we provide a sysfs file (/sys/power/pm_test) for
remote:          selecting one of a few suspend test modes, where rather than entering a
remote:          full suspend state, the kernel will perform some subset of suspend
remote:          steps, wait 5 seconds, and then resume back to normal operation.
remote:
remote:          This mode is useful for (among other things) observing the state of the
remote:          system just before entering a sleep mode, for debugging or analysis
remote:          purposes. However, a constant 5 second wait is not sufficient for some
remote:          sorts of analysis; for example, on an SoC, one might want to use
remote:          external tools to probe the power states of various on-chip controllers
remote:          or clocks.
remote:
remote:          This patch turns this 5 second delay into a configurable module
remote:          parameter, so users can determine how long to wait in this
remote:          pseudo-suspend state before resuming the system.
remote:
remote:          Example (wait 30 seconds);
remote:
remote:            # echo 30 > /sys/module/suspend/parameters/pm_test_delay
remote:            # echo core > /sys/power/pm_test
remote:            # time echo mem  > /sys/power/state
remote:            ...
remote:            [   17.583625] suspend debug: Waiting for 30 second(s).

remote:          spi-brcmstb: Fix BUG() when crossing 4MB boundaries
remote:
remote:          On BSPI <= V3 controllers, the hardware remaps the address bits in a way
remote:          that can cause trouble for transfers that cross a 4MB boundary.  For such
remote:          transfers, we currently BUG() out.  Change the driver behavior so that it
remote:          falls back gracefully to MSPI instead.
remote:
remote:          On BSPI >= V4 controllers, the hardware allows us to disable the remapping
remote:          logic.  So disable remapping during initialization, and disable the driver
remote:          code that modified and checked the address.

remote:          RM: Add Broadcom Brahma-B15 readahead cache support
remote:
remote:          This patch adds support for the Broadcom Brahma-B15 CPU readahead cache
remote:          controller. This cache controller sits between the L2 and the memory bus
remote:          and its purpose is to provide a friendler burst size towards the DDR
remote:          interface than the native cache line size.
remote:
remote:          The readahead cache is mostly transparent, except for
remote:          flush_kern_cache_all, flush_kern_cache_louis and flush_icache_all, which
remote:          is precisely what we are overriding here.
remote:
remote:          The readahead cache only intercepts reads, not writes, as such, some
remote:          data can remain stale in any of its buffers, such that we need to flush
remote:          it, which is an operation that needs to happen in a particular order:
remote:
remote:          - disable the readahead cache
remote:          - flush it
remote:          - call the appropriate cache-v7.S function
remote:          - re-enable
remote:
remote:          This patch tries to minimize the impact to the cache-v7.S file by only
remote:          providing a stub in case CONFIG_CACHE_B15_RAC is enabled (default for
remote:          ARCH_BRCMSTB since it is the current user).

remote:          BCMGENET: Properly disable password matching when requested
remote:
remote:          Ever since the BCMGENET driver was introduced, we had a small issue in the
remote:          driver with enabling/disabling password matching for magic packets.
remote:
remote:          Once we ask the driver to match against a magic packet with a password, we will
remote:          never clear the MPD_PWD_EN bit again, which means that we leave the hardware
remote:          matching magic packets with password.
remote:
remote:          Fix this by clearing the bit when WAKE_MAGICSECURE is not set.

remote:          PM: hack around a BSP race condition
remote:
remote:          Changes to the PM code have uncovered that if the host is too fast at
remote:          submitting BSP commands (e.g., clock stop and gen_random_key), the BSP
remote:          might not ever respond properly, causing a timeout.
remote:
remote:          According to the BSP firmware team, a few milliseconds (~2-3) wait after
remote:          the clock stop command should be sufficient to fend of such races within
remote:          the BSP. Let's add the hack.

remote:
remote:          Implement the bridge join, leave and set_stp callbacks by making that we
remote:          do the following:
remote:
remote:          - when a port joins the bridge, all existing ports in the bridge get
remote:            their VLAN control register updated with that joining port
remote:          - the joining port is including all existing bridge ports in its own
remote:            VLAN control register
remote:
remote:          The leave operation is fairly similar, special care must be taken to
remote:          make sure that port leaving the bridging is not removing itself from its
remote:          own VLAN control register.
remote:
remote:          Since the various BR_* states apply directly to our HW semantics, we just
remote:          need to translate these constants into their corresponding HW settings,
remote:          and voila!
remote:
remote:          We make sure to trigger a fast-ageing process for ports that are
remote:          joining/leaving the bridge and transition from incompatible states, this
remote:          is equivalent to triggering an ARL flush for that port.

remote:
remote:          We also take care of setting the correct STP state when slave network

remote:
remote:          Finally, when a port is leaving the bridge, we make sure we set in
remote:          BR_STATE_FORWARDING state, otherwise the bridge layer would leave it
remote:          disabled as a result of having left the bridge.

remote:          non-zero order_per_bit values.
remote:
remote:          For example, if cma->order_per_bit=1, cma->base_pfn=
remote:          0x2f800000 and align_order=12, the function returns
remote:          a value of 0x17c00 instead of 0x400.
remote:
remote:          This patch fixes the CMA aligned offset calculation.

remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit e48322abb061d75096fe52d71886b237e7ae7bfb]
remote:
remote:          When the system boots up, in the dmesg logs we can see the memory
remote:          statistics along with total reserved as below.  Memory: 458840k/458840k
remote:          available, 65448k reserved, 0K highmem
remote:
remote:          When CMA is enabled, still the total reserved memory remains the same.
remote:          However, the CMA memory is not considered as reserved.  But, when we see
remote:          /proc/meminfo, the CMA memory is part of free memory.  This creates
remote:          confusion.  This patch corrects the problem by properly subtracting the
remote:          CMA reserved memory from the total reserved memory in dmesg logs.
remote:
remote:          Below is the dmesg snapshot from an arm based device with 512MB RAM and
remote:          12MB single CMA region.
remote:
remote:          Before this change:

remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit b5be83e308f70e16c63c4e520ea7bb03ef57c46f]
remote:
remote:          The alignment in cma_alloc() was done w.r.t. the bitmap.  This is a
remote:          problem when, for example:
remote:
remote:          - a device requires 16M (order 12) alignment
remote:          - the CMA region is not 16 M aligned
remote:
remote:          In such a case, can result with the CMA region starting at, say,
remote:          0x2f800000 but any allocation you make from there will be aligned from
remote:          there.  Requesting an allocation of 32 M with 16 M alignment will result
remote:          in an allocation from 0x2f800000 to 0x31800000, which doesn't work very
remote:          well if your strange device requires 16M alignment.
remote:
remote:          Change to use bitmap_find_next_zero_area_off() to account for the
remote:          difference in alignment at reserve-time and alloc-time.

remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit dae803e165a11bc88ca8dbc07a11077caf97bbcb]
remote:
remote:          Having test_pages_isolated failure message as a warning confuses users
remote:          into thinking that it is more serious than it really is.  In reality, if

remote:

remote:          tmon: tui: fixup windowing calculations
remote:
remote:          The number of rows in the dialog vary according to the number of cooling
remote:          devices. However, some of the windowing computations were assuming a
remote:          fixed number of rows. This computation is OK when we have between 4 and
remote:          9 cooling devices (and they wrap to the next column), but with fewer
remote:          devices, we end up printing off the end of the window.
remote:
remote:          This unifies the row computation into a single function and uses that
remote:          throughout the TUI code. This also accounts for increasing the number of
remote:          rows when there are more than 9 total cooling devices.

remote:          CMA: use total cma pages for adjust_managed_cma_page_count
remote:
remote:          In the previous commit ("CMA: aggressively allocate the pages on CMA reserved
remote:          memory when not used" by Joonsoo Kim), CMA allocation is changed to be based on
remote:          the total number of "normal" managed pages and the number of managed (aka not
remote:          CMA-allocated) CMA pages.  This was intended to be used in conjunction with a
remote:          commit "CMA: always treat free cma pages as non-free on watermark checking"[1].
remote:          However, including that change results in a severe limitation that cannot be
remote:          used on brcmstb with the current setup: it restricts the amount of CMA region
remote:          memory to be less than or equal to to one-half of the system memory.
remote:
remote:          Rather than applying that change, this alters the heuristic from the
remote:          previous commit: we change the definition of "normal" manages in a zone from
remote:
remote:            total pages - managed (unallocated) CMA pages - high_wmark_pages(zone)
remote:
remote:          to
remote:
remote:            total pages - total CMA pages
remote:
remote:          This eliminates the need to handle determining whether an allocation should
remote:          succeed or fail based on the watermark check, and allows for memory in CMA
remote:          regions to be used for movable allocations even if there isn't any extra room
remote:          to migrate them out of the CMA region.
remote:
remote:          The obvious and rather large caveat is that in the event of a CMA allocation
remote:          actually requiring that space, there might not be enough space available to
remote:          which to move the used pages in the CMA region, resulting in potentially
remote:          catastrophic CMA allocation failures.  Whereas Joonsoo's commit prevents that
remote:          by design but restricts CMA usage, this maintains flexibility for CMA region
remote:          use but leaves it to the system designer to handle CMA allocation failure.

remote:          CMA: aggressively allocate the pages on CMA reserved memory when not used
remote:
remote:          [Retrieved from
remote:          https://github.com/JoonsooKim/linux/commit/33a0416b3ac1cd7c88e6b35ee61b4a81a7a14afc]
remote:
remote:          CMA is introduced to provide physically contiguous pages at runtime.
remote:          For this purpose, it reserves memory at boot time. Although it reserve
remote:          memory, this reserved memory can be used for movable memory allocation
remote:          request. This usecase is beneficial to the system that needs this CMA
remote:          reserved memory infrequently and it is one of main purpose of
remote:          introducing CMA.
remote:
remote:          But, there is a problem in current implementation. The problem is that
remote:          it works like as just reserved memory approach. The pages on CMA reserved
remote:          memory are hardly used for movable memory allocation. This is caused by
remote:          combination of allocation and reclaim policy.
remote:
remote:          The pages on CMA reserved memory are allocated if there is no movable
remote:          memory, that is, as fallback allocation. So the time this fallback
remote:          allocation is started is under heavy memory pressure. Although it is under
remote:          memory pressure, movable allocation easily succeed, since there would be
remote:          many pages on CMA reserved memory. But this is not the case for unmovable
remote:          and reclaimable allocation, because they can't use the pages on CMA
remote:          reserved memory. These allocations regard system's free memory as
remote:          (free pages - free CMA pages) on watermark checking, that is, free
remote:          unmovable pages + free reclaimable pages + free movable pages. Because
remote:          we already exhausted movable pages, only free pages we have are unmovable
remote:          and reclaimable types and this would be really small amount. So watermark
remote:          checking would be failed. It will wake up kswapd to make enough free
remote:          memory for unmovable and reclaimable allocation and kswapd will do.
remote:          So before we fully utilize pages on CMA reserved memory, kswapd start to
remote:          reclaim memory and try to make free memory over the high watermark. This
remote:          watermark checking by kswapd doesn't take care free CMA pages so many
remote:          movable pages would be reclaimed. After then, we have a lot of movable
remote:          pages again, so fallback allocation doesn't happen again. To conclude,
remote:          amount of free memory on meminfo which includes free CMA pages is moving
remote:          around 512 MB if I reserve 512 MB memory for CMA.
remote:
remote:          I found this problem on following experiment.
remote:
remote:          4 CPUs, 1024 MB, VIRTUAL MACHINE
remote:          make -j16
remote:
remote:          CMA reserve:            0 MB            512 MB
remote:          Elapsed-time:           225.2           472.5
remote:          Average-MemFree:        322490 KB       630839 KB
remote:
remote:          To solve this problem, I can think following 2 possible solutions.
remote:          1. allocate the pages on CMA reserved memory first, and if they are
remote:             exhausted, allocate movable pages.
remote:          2. interleaved allocation: try to allocate specific amounts of memory
remote:             from CMA reserved memory and then allocate from free movable memory.
remote:
remote:          I tested #1 approach and found the problem. Although free memory on
remote:          meminfo can move around low watermark, there is large fluctuation on free
remote:          memory, because too many pages are reclaimed when kswapd is invoked.
remote:          Reason for this behaviour is that successive allocated CMA pages are
remote:          on the LRU list in that order and kswapd reclaim them in same order.
remote:          These memory doesn't help watermark checking from kwapd, so too many
remote:          pages are reclaimed, I guess.
remote:
remote:          So, I implement #2 approach.
remote:          One thing I should note is that we should not change allocation target
remote:          (movable list or CMA) on each allocation attempt, since this prevent
remote:          allocated pages to be in physically succession, so some I/O devices can
remote:          be hurt their performance. To solve this, I keep allocation target
remote:          in at least pageblock_nr_pages attempts and make this number reflect
remote:          ratio, free pages without free CMA pages to free CMA pages. With this
remote:          approach, system works very smoothly and fully utilize the pages on
remote:          CMA reserved memory.
remote:
remote:          Following is the experimental result of this patch.

remote:
remote:          There is no difference if we don't have CMA reserved memory (0 MB case).
remote:          But, with CMA reserved memory (512 MB case), we fully utilize these
remote:          reserved memory through this patch and the system behaves like as
remote:          it doesn't reserve any memory.
remote:
remote:          With this patch, we aggressively allocate the pages on CMA reserved memory
remote:          so latency of CMA can arise. Below is the experimental result about
remote:          latency.
remote:
remote:          4 CPUs, 1024 MB, VIRTUAL MACHINE
remote:          CMA reserve: 512 MB
remote:          Backgound Workload: make -jN
remote:          Real Workload: 8 MB CMA allocation/free 20 times with 5 sec interval
remote:
remote:          N:                    1        4       8        16
remote:          Elapsed-time(Before): 4309.75  9511.09 12276.1  77103.5
remote:          Elapsed-time(After):  5391.69 16114.1  19380.3  34879.2
remote:
remote:          So generally we can see latency increase. Ratio of this increase
remote:          is rather big - up to 70%. But, under the heavy workload, it shows
remote:          latency decrease - up to 55%. This may be worst-case scenario, but
remote:          reducing it would be important for some system, so, I can say that
remote:          this patch have advantages and disadvantages in terms of latency.
remote:
remote:          Although I think that this patch is right direction for CMA, there is
remote:          side-effect in following case. If there is small memory zone and CMA
remote:          occupys most of them, LRU for this zone would have many CMA pages. When
remote:          reclaim is started, these CMA pages would be reclaimed, but not counted
remote:          for watermark checking, so too many CMA pages could be reclaimed
remote:          unnecessarily. Until now, this can't happen because free CMA pages aren't
remote:          used easily. But, with this patch, free CMA pages are used easily so
remote:          this problem can be possible. I will handle it on another patchset
remote:          after some investigating.
remote:
remote:          v2:
remote:            - In fastpath, just replenish counters. Calculation is done whenver
remote:              CMA area is varied
remote:
remote:          v3:
remote:            - Use unsigned type in adjust_managed_cma_page_count() (per Gioh)
remote:            - Fix +/- count when calling adjust_managed_cma_page_count() (per Gioh)
remote:            - Instead of implementing __rmqueue_cma() which has another
remote:              __rmqueue_smallest(), choose_rmqueue_migratetype() is implemented to
remote:              change original migratetype to MIGRATE_CMA according to criteria. It
remote:              helps not to violate layering. (per Minchan in offline discussion)

remote:          CMA: remove redundant retrying code in __alloc_contig_migrate_range
remote:
remote:          [Upstream submission (not yet accepted) https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/5/28/113]
remote:
remote:          We already have retry logic in migrate_pages(). It does retry 10 times.
remote:          So if we keep this retrying code in __alloc_contig_migrate_range(), we
remote:          would try to migrate some unmigratable page in 50 times. There is just one
remote:          small difference in -ENOMEM case. migrate_pages() don't do retry
remote:          in this case, however, current __alloc_contig_migrate_range() does. But,
remote:          I think that this isn't problem, because in this case, we may fail again
remote:          with same reason.

remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 3c605096d3158216ba9326a16266f6ba128c2c8d]
remote:
remote:          Current pageblock isolation logic could isolate each pageblock
remote:          individually.  This causes freepage accounting problem if freepage with
remote:          pageblock order on isolate pageblock is merged with other freepage on
remote:          normal pageblock.  We can prevent merging by restricting max order of
remote:          merging to pageblock order if freepage is on isolate pageblock.
remote:
remote:          A side-effect of this change is that there could be non-merged buddy
remote:          freepage even if finishing pageblock isolation, because undoing
remote:          pageblock isolation is just to move freepage from isolate buddy list to
remote:          normal buddy list rather than to consider merging.  So, the patch also
remote:          makes undoing pageblock isolation consider freepage merge.  When
remote:          un-isolation, freepage with more than pageblock order and it's buddy are
remote:          checked.  If they are on normal pageblock, instead of just moving, we
remote:          isolate the freepage and free it in order to get merged.

remote:          mm/page_alloc: move freepage counting logic to __free_one_page()
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 8f82b55dd558a74fc33d69a1f2c2605d0cd2c908]
remote:
remote:          All the caller of __free_one_page() has similar freepage counting logic,
remote:          so we can move it to __free_one_page().  This reduce line of code and

remote:
remote:          This is also preparation step for "mm/page_alloc: restrict max order of
remote:          merging on isolated pageblock" which fix the freepage counting problem
remote:          on freepage with more than pageblock order.

remote:          mm/page_alloc: add freepage on isolate pageblock to correct buddy list
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 51bb1a4093cc68bc16b282548d9cee6104be0ef1]
remote:
remote:          In free_pcppages_bulk(), we use cached migratetype of freepage to
remote:          determine type of buddy list where freepage will be added.  This
remote:          information is stored when freepage is added to pcp list, so if
remote:          isolation of pageblock of this freepage begins after storing, this
remote:          cached information could be stale.  In other words, it has original
remote:          migratetype rather than MIGRATE_ISOLATE.
remote:
remote:          There are two problems caused by this stale information.
remote:
remote:          One is that we can't keep these freepages from being allocated.
remote:          Although this pageblock is isolated, freepage will be added to normal
remote:          buddy list so that it could be allocated without any restriction.  And
remote:          the other problem is incorrect freepage accounting.  Freepages on
remote:          isolate pageblock should not be counted for number of freepage.
remote:
remote:          Following is the code snippet in free_pcppages_bulk().
remote:
remote:              /* MIGRATE_MOVABLE list may include MIGRATE_RESERVEs */
remote:              __free_one_page(page, page_to_pfn(page), zone, 0, mt);
remote:              trace_mm_page_pcpu_drain(page, 0, mt);
remote:              if (likely(!is_migrate_isolate_page(page))) {
remote:                  __mod_zone_page_state(zone, NR_FREE_PAGES, 1);
remote:                  if (is_migrate_cma(mt))
remote:                      __mod_zone_page_state(zone, NR_FREE_CMA_PAGES, 1);
remote:              }
remote:
remote:          As you can see above snippet, current code already handle second
remote:          problem, incorrect freepage accounting, by re-fetching pageblock
remote:          migratetype through is_migrate_isolate_page(page).
remote:
remote:          But, because this re-fetched information isn't used for
remote:          __free_one_page(), first problem would not be solved.  This patch try to
remote:          solve this situation to re-fetch pageblock migratetype before
remote:          __free_one_page() and to use it for __free_one_page().
remote:
remote:          In addition to move up position of this re-fetch, this patch use
remote:          optimization technique, re-fetching migratetype only if there is isolate
remote:          pageblock.  Pageblock isolation is rare event, so we can avoid
remote:          re-fetching in common case with this optimization.
remote:
remote:          This patch also correct migratetype of the tracepoint output.

remote:          mm/page_alloc: fix incorrect isolation behavior by rechecking migratetype
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit ad53f92eb416d81e469fa8ea57153e59455e7175]
remote:
remote:          Before describing bugs itself, I first explain definition of freepage.
remote:
remote:           1. pages on buddy list are counted as freepage.
remote:           2. pages on isolate migratetype buddy list are *not* counted as freepage.
remote:           3. pages on cma buddy list are counted as CMA freepage, too.
remote:
remote:          Now, I describe problems and related patch.
remote:
remote:          Patch 1: There is race conditions on getting pageblock migratetype that
remote:          it results in misplacement of freepages on buddy list, incorrect
remote:          freepage count and un-availability of freepage.
remote:
remote:          Patch 2: Freepages on pcp list could have stale cached information to
remote:          determine migratetype of buddy list to go.  This causes misplacement of
remote:          freepages on buddy list and incorrect freepage count.
remote:
remote:          Patch 4: Merging between freepages on different migratetype of
remote:          pageblocks will cause freepages accouting problem.  This patch fixes it.
remote:
remote:          Without patchset [3], above problem doesn't happens on my CMA allocation
remote:          test, because CMA reserved pages aren't used at all.  So there is no
remote:          chance for above race.
remote:
remote:          With patchset [3], I did simple CMA allocation test and get below
remote:          result:
remote:
remote:           - Virtual machine, 4 cpus, 1024 MB memory, 256 MB CMA reservation
remote:           - run kernel build (make -j16) on background
remote:           - 30 times CMA allocation(8MB * 30 = 240MB) attempts in 5 sec interval
remote:           - Result: more than 5000 freepage count are missed
remote:
remote:          With patchset [3] and this patchset, I found that no freepage count are
remote:          missed so that I conclude that problems are solved.
remote:
remote:          On my simple memory offlining test, these problems also occur on that
remote:          environment, too.
remote:
remote:          This patch (of 4):
remote:
remote:          There are two paths to reach core free function of buddy allocator,
remote:          __free_one_page(), one is free_one_page()->__free_one_page() and the
remote:          other is free_hot_cold_page()->free_pcppages_bulk()->__free_one_page().
remote:          Each paths has race condition causing serious problems.  At first, this
remote:          patch is focused on first type of freepath.  And then, following patch
remote:          will solve the problem in second type of freepath.
remote:
remote:          In the first type of freepath, we got migratetype of freeing page
remote:          without holding the zone lock, so it could be racy.  There are two cases
remote:          of this race.
remote:
remote:           1. pages are added to isolate buddy list after restoring orignal
remote:              migratetype
remote:
remote:              CPU1                                   CPU2
remote:
remote:              get migratetype => return MIGRATE_ISOLATE
remote:              call free_one_page() with MIGRATE_ISOLATE
remote:
remote:                                          grab the zone lock
remote:                                          unisolate pageblock
remote:                                          release the zone lock
remote:
remote:              grab the zone lock
remote:              call __free_one_page() with MIGRATE_ISOLATE
remote:              freepage go into isolate buddy list,
remote:              although pageblock is already unisolated
remote:
remote:          This may cause two problems.  One is that we can't use this page anymore
remote:          until next isolation attempt of this pageblock, because freepage is on
remote:          isolate buddy list.  The other is that freepage accouting could be wrong
remote:          due to merging between different buddy list.  Freepages on isolate buddy
remote:          list aren't counted as freepage, but ones on normal buddy list are
remote:          counted as freepage.  If merge happens, buddy freepage on normal buddy
remote:          list is inevitably moved to isolate buddy list without any consideration
remote:          of freepage accouting so it could be incorrect.
remote:
remote:           2. pages are added to normal buddy list while pageblock is isolated.
remote:              It is similar with above case.
remote:
remote:          This also may cause two problems.  One is that we can't keep these
remote:          freepages from being allocated.  Although this pageblock is isolated,
remote:          freepage would be added to normal buddy list so that it could be
remote:          allocated without any restriction.  And the other problem is same as
remote:          case 1, that it, incorrect freepage accouting.
remote:
remote:          This race condition would be prevented by checking migratetype again
remote:          with holding the zone lock.  Because it is somewhat heavy operation and
remote:          it isn't needed in common case, we want to avoid rechecking as much as
remote:          possible.  So this patch introduce new variable, nr_isolate_pageblock in
remote:          struct zone to check if there is isolated pageblock.  With this, we can
remote:          avoid to re-check migratetype in common case and do it only if there is
remote:          isolated pageblock or migratetype is MIGRATE_ISOLATE.  This solve above
remote:          mentioned problems.
remote:
remote:          Changes from v3:
remote:          Add one more check in free_one_page() that checks whether migratetype is
remote:          MIGRATE_ISOLATE or not. Without this, abovementioned case 1 could happens.

remote:          mm: cma: Ensure that reservations never cross the low/high mem boundary
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 16195ddd4ebcc10c30b2f232f8e400df8d464380]
remote:
remote:          Commit 95b0e655f914 ("ARM: mm: don't limit default CMA region only to
remote:          low memory") extended CMA memory reservation to allow usage of high
remote:          memory. It relied on commit f7426b983a6a ("mm: cma: adjust address limit
remote:          to avoid hitting low/high memory boundary") to ensure that the reserved
remote:          block never crossed the low/high memory boundary. While the
remote:          implementation correctly lowered the limit, it failed to consider the
remote:          case where the base..limit range crossed the low/high memory boundary
remote:          with enough space on each side to reserve the requested size on either
remote:          low or high memory.
remote:
remote:          Rework the base and limit adjustment to fix the problem. The function
remote:          now starts by rejecting the reservation altogether for fixed
remote:          reservations that cross the boundary, tries to reserve from high memory
remote:          first and then falls back to low memory.

remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 800a85d3d286604b8c539ca7ee90b992316fd2a7]
remote:
remote:          The fixed parameter to cma_declare_contiguous() tells the function
remote:          whether the given base address must be honoured or should be considered
remote:          as a hint only. The API considers a zero base address as meaning any
remote:          base address, which must never be considered as a fixed value.
remote:
remote:          Part of the implementation correctly checks both fixed and base != 0,
remote:          but two locations check the fixed value only. Set fixed to false when
remote:          base is 0 to fix that and simplify the code.

remote:          mm/cma: fix cma bitmap aligned mask computing
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 68faed630fc151a7a1c4853df00fb3dcacf782b4]
remote:
remote:          The current cma bitmap aligned mask computation is incorrect.  It could
remote:          cause an unexpected alignment when using cma_alloc() if the wanted align
remote:          order is larger than cma->order_per_bit.
remote:
remote:          Take kvm for example (PAGE_SHIFT = 12), kvm_cma->order_per_bit is set to
remote:          6.  When kvm_alloc_rma() tries to alloc kvm_rma_pages, it will use 15 as
remote:          the expected align value.  After using the current implementation however,
remote:          we get 0 as cma bitmap aligned mask other than 511.
remote:
remote:          This patch fixes the cma bitmap aligned mask calculation.

remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit f7426b983a6a353cf21e5733e84458219c4a817e]
remote:
remote:          Russell King recently noticed that limiting default CMA region only to low
remote:          memory on ARM architecture causes serious memory management issues with
remote:          machines having a lot of memory (which is mainly available as high
remote:          memory).  More information can be found the following thread:
remote:          http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.ports.arm.kernel/348441/
remote:
remote:          Those two patches removes this limit letting kernel to put default CMA
remote:          region into high memory when this is possible (there is enough high memory
remote:          available and architecture specific DMA limit fits).
remote:
remote:          This should solve strange OOM issues on systems with lots of RAM (i.e.
remote:          >1GiB) and large (>256M) CMA area.
remote:
remote:          This patch (of 2):
remote:
remote:          Automatically allocated regions should not cross low/high memory boundary,
remote:          because such regions cannot be later correctly initialized due to spanning
remote:          across two memory zones.  This patch adds a check for this case and a
remote:          simple code for moving region to low memory if automatically selected
remote:          address might not fit completely into high memory.

remote:          CMA: generalize CMA reserved area management functionality
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit a254129e8686bff7a340b58f35241b04927e81c0]
remote:
remote:          Currently, there are two users on CMA functionality, one is the DMA
remote:          subsystem and the other is the KVM on powerpc.  They have their own code
remote:          to manage CMA reserved area even if they looks really similar.  From my
remote:          guess, it is caused by some needs on bitmap management.  KVM side wants
remote:          to maintain bitmap not for 1 page, but for more size.  Eventually it use
remote:          bitmap where one bit represents 64 pages.
remote:
remote:          When I implement CMA related patches, I should change those two places
remote:          to apply my change and it seem to be painful to me.  I want to change
remote:          this situation and reduce future code management overhead through this
remote:          patch.
remote:
remote:          This change could also help developer who want to use CMA in their new
remote:          feature development, since they can use CMA easily without copying &
remote:          pasting this reserved area management code.
remote:
remote:          In previous patches, we have prepared some features to generalize CMA
remote:          reserved area management and now it's time to do it.  This patch moves
remote:          core functions to mm/cma.c and change DMA APIs to use these functions.
remote:
remote:          There is no functional change in DMA APIs.

remote:          cma: add placement specifier for "cma=" kernel parameter
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 5ea3b1b2f8ad9162684431ce6188102ca4c64b7a]
remote:
remote:          Currently, "cma=" kernel parameter is used to specify the size of CMA,
remote:          but we can't specify where it is located.  We want to locate CMA below
remote:          4GB for devices only supporting 32-bit addressing on 64-bit systems
remote:          without iommu.
remote:
remote:          This enables to specify the placement of CMA by extending "cma=" kernel
remote:          parameter.
remote:
remote:          Examples:
remote:           1. locate 64MB CMA below 4GB by "cma=64M@0-4G"
remote:           2. locate 64MB CMA exact at 512MB by "cma=64M@512M"
remote:
remote:          Note that the DMA contiguous memory allocator on x86 assumes that
remote:          page_address() works for the pages to allocate.  So this change requires
remote:          to limit end address of contiguous memory area upto max_pfn_mapped to
remote:          prevent from locating it on highmem area by the argument of
remote:          dma_contiguous_reserve().

remote:          [Upstream commit 7ee793a62fa8c544f8b844e6e87b2d8e8836b219]
remote:
remote:          CMA locking is currently very coarse. The cma_mutex protects both
remote:          the bitmap and avoids concurrency with alloc_contig_range. There
remote:          are several situations which may result in a deadlock on the CMA
remote:          mutex currently, mostly involving AB/BA situations with alloc and
remote:          free. Fix this issue by protecting the bitmap with a mutex per CMA
remote:          region and use the existing mutex for protecting against concurrency
remote:          with alloc_contig_range.

remote:          thermal: powerclamp: Add support for ARM machine to powerclamp driver.
remote:
remote:          This patch modifies intel_powerclamp driver can be used in not only x86
remote:          but also ARM. Any ARM system can use intel_powerclamp driver for managing
remote:          thermal problem through injecting intentional idle cycle. The required
remote:          modification is only that it replaces x86's instruction, mwait, with arm
remote:          specific one, wfi and changes the way of calculation of idle rate of last
remote:          window. Other algorithm and codes can be shared without any amendment.

remote:          - additional inlining and BCM_FASTPATH additions.
remote:          - switched back to KTHREAD from tasklets in 3390
remote:          - introduced BUZZZ profiling framework in data path

remote:  PROBLEM
remote:  ========
remote:  Here are the thread details and how they are interlocked with each other with explanations under each:
remote:
remote:  a) spi1 thread : spi_pump_messages()->bcm63xx_hsspi_transfer_one()->wait_for_common()
remote:  - here we executed a SPI transaction and started interrupts and waiting for a completion() via a SPI interrupt telling us CMD_DONE
remote:  - our thread is in the RUN state, the CMD_DONE mask is cleared, and this thread appears to be read to run but the scheduler is not getting to us
remote:  - our task priority is 120
remote:
remote:  b) ip thread   : rtnetlink_rcv()->dev_get_stats()->dqnet_get_stats()->ethsw_spi()->__spi_sync()->wait_for_completion()
remote:  - #1 TAKE rtnl_lock() inside of rtnetlink_rcv()
remote:  - here we are stuck waiting on spi_pump_messages() to process our command and do the SPI transaction then tell us, however spi_pump is stuck (from a)
remote:  - this thread is causing many other threads to get stuck: dhcpd, wlmngr, and associated kworker threads
remote:  - this thread is called by a shell thread that was called by snmpd to collect counter stats
remote:
remote:  c) mocad thread: kerSysBcmSpiSlaveRead()->__spi_sync()->wait_for_completion()
remote:  - here we are stuck waiting on spi_pump_messages() to process our command and do the SPI transaction then tell us, however spi_pump is stuck (from a)
remote:
remote:  d) sh thread   : CMS->system call 'echo 0 >> /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/disable_ipv6'->addrconf_disable_ipv6()->rtnl_trylock()->restart_syscall()->LOOP FOREVER!!
remote:  - this is kicked off by ssk (CMS)
remote:  - #2 TRY TO TAKE rtnl_trylock() but it is taken (from b)
remote:  - our task priority is 94 which is higher than 120
remote:   #3 failure to take the mutex causes us to call restart_syscall() and re-run the system call, putting us in a continuous loop at super high priority
remote:
remote:  e) CM console  : stuck on atomic HW mutex that is held (from a)
remote:
remote:  f) RG console   : console is not working,
remote:  - we never get a login shell console because /etc/inittab executes /etc/init.d/rsS and in the end there calls us to ping 172.31.255.4
remote:  - this ping fails because ip thread is stuck
remote:  - shell would have started after this but we never made it that far
remote:
remote:  SOLUTION
remote:  ========
remote:  The problem is addrconf.c which is what we use to configure ipv6 addresses has bug.  I checked and the latest version is the same as ours.  The issue is this:
remote:
remote:  static int addrconf_disable_ipv6(struct ctl_table *table, int *p, int newf)
remote:  {
remote:          struct net *net;
remote:          int old;
remote:
remote:          if (!rtnl_trylock())
remote:                  return restart_syscall();
remote:  ...
remote:  }
remote:
remote:  Basically CMS calls a shell to execute a proc command to disable ipv6. It gets into this above function and tries the rtnl_trylock() which is essentially a mutex_trylock() which does NOT block.  It does not get the mutex because we have it already taken and then calls restart_syscall() which essentially re-executes the system call causing us to spin in a continuous loop.  The mutex_trylock() is only supposed to be by the same thread, but we cant.  We have snmp doing rtnlink calls to get counters and CMS doing proc shell calls both using this mutex.
remote:
remote:  FIX
remote:  ===
remote:  I fixed 4 things for this:
remote:
remote:  1) Moved shell/login to start before rcS scripts so we always have a shell
remote:
remote:  2) Fix issue where if we timeout in SPI driver we still finish the SPI transaction before we leave (this was my first fix, which is still valid just a fix for a problem we have not hit yet)
remote:
remote:  3) Change ssk thread to use regular priority as everyone else, 120 vs 94, verified shells spawn at 120 as well.  This allows us to swap out and let same priority tasks to run and clean up their mutex locks.
remote:
remote:  4) Modified linux/net/ipv6/addrconf.c to not use restart_syscall() and switched the rtnl_trylock() to rtnl_lock() so we wait and let the other threads unlock the mutex.

remote:  - Create a proprietary LKM that can periodically poll the MemC
remote:    Statistics registers of the 3390B0 and pull all of the stats into a
remote:  somewhat small array for short-term collection.  The driver always
remote:  collects the stats for the entire controller and can be put in a mode to
remote:  collect either the VIPER bus stats or the ARM/SCB bus stats.
remote:
remote:  - Create a userspace apps that loads the LKM and is able to configure it
remote:    and poll it for longer-term data collection and collation.  The app
remote:  grabs the LKM's data and stores it into a long-term buffer after
remote:  calculating numerous memc statistics (provided by Herman Liu) on the
remote:  data. It is able to fully unload the LKM given a specific option as
remote:  well.
remote:
remote:  - Portions of the LKM came from some BRCM DSL code that was created on a
remote:    similar Memory Controller.  I heavily modified it to do what Dave P
remote:  asked for for the 3390B0.
remote:
remote:  - Both the LKM and the app are DISABLED by default in the build.  They
remote:    can be enabled by flipping CONFIG_BCM_MEMCSTATS to 'm' in
remote:  linux/drivers/bcm_media_gw/Kconfig.  This will automagically flip the
remote:  userspace BUILD_MEMCSTATS flag to y and build both.
remote:
remote:  - Added the userspace app to the two skiplists I'm aware of.  The LKM
remote:    should already be handled by one of the lines in those two files.
remote:
remote:  - the _proc file was left in place but is not compiled in case it's
remote:    needed for future debugging.  Early on I used it for basic debugging
remote:  of the LKM.  But later removed it when it was no longer essential.

remote:  netfilter: conntrack: remove central spinlock nf_conntrack_lock
remote:
remote:  nf_conntrack_lock is a monolithic lock and suffers from huge contention
remote:  on current generation servers (8 or more core/threads).
remote:
remote:  Perf locking congestion is clear on base kernel:
remote:
remote:  -  72.56%  ksoftirqd/6  [kernel.kallsyms]    [k] _raw_spin_lock_bh
remote:     - _raw_spin_lock_bh
remote:        + 25.33% init_conntrack
remote:        + 24.86% nf_ct_delete_from_lists
remote:        + 24.62% __nf_conntrack_confirm
remote:        + 24.38% destroy_conntrack
remote:        + 0.70% tcp_packet
remote:  +   2.21%  ksoftirqd/6  [kernel.kallsyms]    [k] fib_table_lookup
remote:  +   1.15%  ksoftirqd/6  [kernel.kallsyms]    [k] __slab_free
remote:  +   0.77%  ksoftirqd/6  [kernel.kallsyms]    [k] inet_getpeer
remote:  +   0.70%  ksoftirqd/6  [nf_conntrack]       [k] nf_ct_delete
remote:  +   0.55%  ksoftirqd/6  [ip_tables]          [k] ipt_do_table
remote:
remote:  This patch change conntrack locking and provides a huge performance
remote:  improvement.  SYN-flood attack tested on a 24-core E5-2695v2(ES) with
remote:  10Gbit/s ixgbe (with tool trafgen):
remote:
remote:   Base kernel:   810.405 new conntrack/sec
remote:   After patch: 2.233.876 new conntrack/sec
remote:
remote:  Notice other floods attack (SYN+ACK or ACK) can easily be deflected using:
remote:   # iptables -A INPUT -m state --state INVALID -j DROP
remote:   # sysctl -w net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_tcp_loose=0
remote:
remote:  Use an array of hashed spinlocks to protect insertions/deletions of
remote:  conntracks into the hash table. 1024 spinlocks seem to give good
remote:  results, at minimal cost (4KB memory). Due to lockdep max depth,
remote:  1024 becomes 8 if CONFIG_LOCKDEP=y
remote:
remote:  The hash resize is a bit tricky, because we need to take all locks in
remote:  the array. A seqcount_t is used to synchronize the hash table users
remote:  with the resizing process.

remote:  netfilter: avoid race with exp->master ct
remote:
remote:  Preparation for disconnecting the nf_conntrack_lock from the
remote:  expectations code.  Once the nf_conntrack_lock is lifted, a race
remote:  condition is exposed.
remote:
remote:  The expectations master conntrack exp->master, can race with
remote:  delete operations, as the refcnt increment happens too late in
remote:  init_conntrack().  Race is against other CPUs invoking
remote:  ->destroy() (destroy_conntrack()), or nf_ct_delete() (via timeout
remote:  or early_drop()).
remote:
remote:  Avoid this race in nf_ct_find_expectation() by using atomic_inc_not_zero(),
remote:  and checking if nf_ct_is_dying() (path via nf_ct_delete()).

remote:  [STB Linux commit 54158f410272e9b8d02df6cdd02949706b142cb5]
remote:
remote:  This reverts commit bd08857fde1fc4c2bd2b05aced340f85a721059e ("gpio: brcmstb:
remote:  switch to using gpiolib irqchip helpers"). The conversion to using GPIOLIB IRQ
remote:  chip helpers was very appealing, but badly broke the 1:1 mapping between a GPIO
remote:  controller's device_node and its interrupt domain.
remote:
remote:  Revert back to a version where we have one larger interrupt domain per GPIO
remote:  controller instance spanning multiple GPIO.

remote:  [STB Linux commit 173ad8713acd27ed8ff50661fbe29eb2ddd2163d]
remote:
remote:  When an error occurs during the initialization of a bank's basic mmio
remote:  gpio device the resources associated with that device must be released.
remote:
remote:  The basic mmio gpio API defines the bgpio_remove() method for this purpose.
remote:  However, since the bgpio_init() method does not add the associated gpiochip
remote:  device directly, an API hazard exists between the bgpio and gpiochip APIs.
remote:
remote:  In principal, if bgpio_init() succeeds then bgpio_remove() should be called
remote:  to release any resources allocated by bgpio_init().  However, since
remote:  bgpio_remove() calls gpiochip_remove() it will currently crash if called
remote:  before gpiochip_add() has succeeded.  This creates a non-explicit dependency
remote:  that leads to brittle code which may break if the underlying implementations
remote:  of these APIs change.
remote:
remote:  I was strongly tempted to just call gpiochip_remove() for the exceptional
remote:  circumstance handled by this commit, but ultimately believe this change
remote:  better reflects the intention of the APIs.

remote:  Flowmgr requires information on input physical network device from where

remote:  this information is lost especially when packet flows through multiple
remote:  bridges or virtual network devices. So far we have avoided changing skbuff.
remote:  But with addition of LAG devices and more future requirements on creating
remote:  complicated network layout require us to add dev_in field in the skbuff
remote:  structure. This dev_in filed is only updated by dqnet driver on packet
remote:  reception.

remote:
remote:          GZIP is the default kernel compression method, while it is a good tradeoff
remote:          between compression ratio and speed, recent additions to the default kernel
remote:          have made us get too close from the 4MB size, which is the typical "kernel"
remote:          partition provided by BOLT. Until we can afford not caring about size, switch
remote:          to the strongest compression algorithm that is supported: XZ, putting us back

remote:          gpio: brcmstb: Fix wake-up on GPIO interrupts
remote:
remote:          The current driver was missing a few key things to allow GPIO interrupts to be
remote:          properly used as wake-up sources as intended:
remote:
remote:          - the IRQCHIP_MASK_ON_SUSPEND should only apply to the non wake-up capable
remote:            controllers
remote:          - we need to know which GPIO interrupt line is requested to be a
remote:            wake-up source, and program its interrupt mask accordingly to make it able to
remote:            wake-up the system
remote:
remote:          In order to accomplish that, we introduce a per-GPIO bank bitmask of active
remote:          sources (wake_active) and program it into GIO_MASK when we are about to
remote:          suspend.

remote:          xfs: remote attribute overwrite causes transaction overrun
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 8275cdd0e7ac550dcce2b3ef6d2fb3b808c1ae59]
remote:
remote:          Commit e461fcb ("xfs: remote attribute lookups require the value
remote:          length") passes the remote attribute length in the xfs_da_args
remote:          structure on lookup so that CRC calculations and validity checking
remote:          can be performed correctly by related code. This, unfortunately has
remote:          the side effect of changing the args->valuelen parameter in cases
remote:          where it shouldn't.
remote:
remote:          That is, when we replace a remote attribute, the incoming
remote:          replacement stores the value and length in args->value and
remote:          args->valuelen, but then the lookup which finds the existing remote
remote:          attribute overwrites args->valuelen with the length of the remote
remote:          attribute being replaced. Hence when we go to create the new
remote:          attribute, we create it of the size of the existing remote
remote:          attribute, not the size it is supposed to be. When the new attribute
remote:          is much smaller than the old attribute, this results in a
remote:          transaction overrun and an ASSERT() failure on a debug kernel:
remote:
remote:          XFS: Assertion failed: tp->t_blk_res_used <= tp->t_blk_res, file: fs/xfs/xfs_trans.c, line: 331
remote:
remote:          Fix this by keeping the remote attribute value length separate to
remote:          the attribute value length in the xfs_da_args structure. The enables
remote:          us to pass the length of the remote attribute to be removed without
remote:          overwriting the new attribute's length.
remote:
remote:          Also, ensure that when we save remote block contexts for a later
remote:          rename we zero the original state variables so that we don't confuse
remote:          the state of the attribute to be removes with the state of the new
remote:          attribute that we just added. [Spotted by Brain Foster.]

remote:          BCMGENET: Power up the internal PHY before probing the MII
remote:
remote:          When using the internal PHY it must be powered up when the MII is probed
remote:          or the PHY will not be detected.  Since the PHY is powered up at reset
remote:          this has not been a problem.  However, when the kernel is restarted with
remote:          kexec the PHY will likely be powered down when the kernel starts so it
remote:          will not be detected and the Ethernet link will not be established.
remote:
remote:          This commit explicitly powers up the internal PHY when the GENET driver
remote:          is probed to correct this behavior.

remote:          KEYS: Fix keyring ref leak in join_session_keyring()
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 23567fd052a9abb6d67fe8e7a9ccdd9800a540f2]
remote:
remote:          This fixes CVE-2016-0728.
remote:
remote:          If a thread is asked to join as a session keyring the keyring that's already
remote:          set as its session, we leak a keyring reference.
remote:
remote:          This can be tested with the following program:
remote:
remote:          	#include <stddef.h>
remote:          	#include <stdio.h>
remote:          	#include <sys/types.h>
remote:          	#include <keyutils.h>
remote:
remote:          	int main(int argc, const char *argv[])
remote:          	{
remote:          		int i = 0;
remote:          		key_serial_t serial;
remote:
remote:          		serial = keyctl(KEYCTL_JOIN_SESSION_KEYRING,
remote:          				"leaked-keyring");
remote:          		if (serial < 0) {
remote:          			perror("keyctl");
remote:          			return -1;
remote:          		}
remote:
remote:          		if (keyctl(KEYCTL_SETPERM, serial,
remote:          			   KEY_POS_ALL | KEY_USR_ALL) < 0) {
remote:          			perror("keyctl");
remote:          			return -1;
remote:          		}
remote:
remote:          		for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
remote:          			serial = keyctl(KEYCTL_JOIN_SESSION_KEYRING,
remote:          					"leaked-keyring");
remote:          			if (serial < 0) {
remote:          				perror("keyctl");
remote:          				return -1;
remote:          			}
remote:          		}
remote:
remote:          		return 0;
remote:          	}
remote:
remote:          If, after the program has run, there something like the following line in
remote:          /proc/keys:
remote:
remote:          3f3d898f I--Q---   100 perm 3f3f0000     0     0 keyring   leaked-keyring: empty
remote:
remote:          with a usage count of 100 * the number of times the program has been run,
remote:          then the kernel is malfunctioning.  If leaked-keyring has zero usages or
remote:          has been garbage collected, then the problem is fixed.

remote:
remote:          When generating an address for bmem_find_region() from a pfn value we

remote:
remote:          The interrupt initialization code has been funky since day 0.
remote:          It doesn't really matter because the current code doesn't
remote:          handle interrupts.  Change the code to be more sensible.

remote:          usb: USB 3.0 device as rootfs fails to recover after S2 or S3
remote:
remote:          On systems using IPP (Invert Port Power), mounted USB 3.0
remote:          devices will get re-enumerated on S3 resume and the mounted
remote:          filesystem will no longer be accessible. This is happening
remote:          because a system using IPP will power up with USB power
remote:          enabled to the USB devices until the IPP can be set by software.
remote:          This is enough time for 3.0 devices to timeout on the 3.0
remote:          connect attempt (because the 3.0 PHY has not yet been enabled)
remote:          and fall back to a 2.0 device. This shouldn't be a problem
remote:          because the 3.0 devices in 2.0 mode would normally be power
remote:          cycled after the software sets IPP correctly, but the USB driver
remote:          turns on device power so quickly after we set IPP that the device
remote:          doesn't see the power cycle (on a 7445SV board it takes about
remote:          8ms for power to drop to zero). This change adds a 50ms delay
remote:          when IPP is being set. The delay is only added if IPP was not
remote:          already set to avoid delays if BOLT already set IPP.

remote:          gpio: brcmstb: define irq_disable service
remote:
remote:          The gpiolib irqchip helpers will use irq_unmask if irq_enable is not
remote:          defined.  However, when using the handle_simple_irq() generic handler
remote:          the irq_disable service will not use irq_mask to disable the interrupt.
remote:
remote:          When using the handle_simple_irq() generic handler it should be enough
remote:          to define irq_enable and irq_disable, but since we are using the flag
remote:          IRQCHIP_MASK_ON_SUSPEND we need to define the irq_mask as well.
remote:
remote:          This commit just defines irq_disabled the same as irq_mask so that
remote:          calls to disable_irq for gpio interrupts will mask the interrupt.

remote:          The ramoops driver prepends a "====timestamp.timestamp-C|D\n"
remote:          header to the compressed record before handing it over to pstore
remote:          driver which doesn't know about the header. In pstore_decompress(),
remote:          the pstore driver reads the first "==" as a zlib header, so the
remote:          decompression always fails. For example, this causes the driver
remote:          to write /dev/pstore/dmesg-ramoops-0.enc.z instead of
remote:          /dev/pstore/dmesg-ramoops-0.
remote:
remote:          This patch makes the ramoops driver remove the header before
remote:          pstore decompression.

remote:          thermal: brcmstb_thermal: represent temperatures with int data type
remote:
remote:          The brcmstb_thermal driver was not properly handling computations of
remote:          negative temperatures.  This was partly attributable to inconsistency
remote:          in the v3.14 kernel thermal API which largely defines temperatures to
remote:          be unsigned.
remote:
remote:          Later versions of the kernel have cleaned up the thermal API to always
remote:          represent temperatures with type int.  This commit changes the internal
remote:          representations of temperatures within the driver to use type int and
remote:          corrects the bounds checking and computations accordingly.

remote:          ARM: mmu: fix default vmalloc size for < 1GiB
remote:
remote:          The current default vmalloc size has been bumped up to
remote:          744MiB for platforms with >= 1 GiB (and if more than one
remote:          meminfo bank exists). As the memory banks > 760MiB (the
remote:          maximum lowmem size for a 3:1 kernel split) are split at
remote:          the lowmem/highmem boundary, the automatic bmem reservation
remote:          scheme breaks when 760MiB < memory size < 1GiB.
remote:
remote:          For example, if the bank size is 768MiB, it's split into
remote:          a 760MiB lowmem and 8MiB highmem bank. The bmem reservation
remote:          algorithm keeps all of the 760MiB for the system and only
remote:          ends up reserving 8MiB for bmem.
remote:
remote:          This patch sets the default vmalloc size for memory banks
remote:          > 760MiB to 744MiB. The change ensures the bmem automatic
remote:          reservation algorithm works correctly for 760MiB < memory
remote:          size < 1GiB.

remote:
remote:          On single memory bank platforms, 20% of the available
remote:          memory is set aside for the system and the rest is reserved
remote:          as bmem. This scheme doesn't work well for very low memory

remote:
remote:          This patches adds the following changes to single memory
remote:          bank configurations:
remote:
remote:          - For bank sizes less than or equal to 128MiB, all memory
remote:          is allocated to the system and bmem reservation is skipped.
remote:
remote:          - For bank sizes larger than 128MiB,
remote:          reserved_bmem = 80% x (bank_size - 128MiB).

remote:          usb: Change the way usb-brcm driver is disable for new USB style DT
remote:
remote:          The new style USB Device Tree uses a usb-phy instead of a
remote:          wrapper (the usb-brcm driver) and this changes the way the
remote:          usb-brcm driver is disabled when the new style is detected. The
remote:          driver now returns ENODEV instead of zero which stop any further
remote:          calls to the driver. This makes the previous commit 01f3e893197a,
remote:          which checked for a NULL priv in suspend and resume, un-necessary.

remote:          usb: Change Broadcom USB drivers structure to remove USB wrapper driver
remote:
remote:          The current Broadcom USB drivers (ohci, ehci, xhci and bdc) are setup
remote:          as child drivers to a USB wrapper driver. The wrapper driver handles
remote:          any global USB controller setup and then starts the child drivers. This
remote:          change will replace the wrapper driver with a usb-phy driver that will
remote:          do the global USB controller setup and the child drivers will become
remote:          normal drivers started by the device tree parser. The new functionality
remote:          requires a new style of USB Device Tree node descriptions and will
remote:          only work with a matching version of BOLT. The kernel will also support
remote:          the old style DT entries so it will work correctly with either version
remote:          of BOLT.

remote:          mmc: Add ability to change driver strength from a Device Tree prop
remote:
remote:          Customers are requesting the ability to change the Host and Card
remote:          Driver Type (drive strength) because they are seeing interference
remote:          with WiFi and having Certification issues. This change allows new
remote:          Device Tree properties to change the default Driver Type for both
remote:          Host and Card. Not all cards support all Driver Types and if the
remote:          requested type is not supported the default will continue to be used.
remote:          The SD spec states that only UHS modes use selectable driver strength,
remote:          but our host controller allows it for HS mode as well. A customer
remote:          has requested support for the HS setting so an additional device
remote:          tree property was added for this.
remote:
remote:          The Device Tree properties that control the drive strength are:
remote:          "host-driver-strength", "host-hs-driver-strength" and
remote:          "card-driver-strength". These properties can have the value
remote:          "A", "B", "C", or "D". Where A is x1.5, B is x1.0 (default),
remote:          C is x0.75 and D is x0.5
remote:
remote:          NOTES
remote:           o Reducing Drive Strength may result in read/write errors
remote:             depending on the board design.
remote:           o The Host side settings are not supported on the 74371, which
remote:             uses the older version of the SDIO core.

remote:          clk: Remove ordering restrictions for software clocks
remote:
remote:          After using "kexec" to load and run a new kernel, the new kernel
remote:          doesn't work normally.
remote:          1. It can't detect the plug/unplug of usb disk/ethernet cable.
remote:          2. If run with a usb disk plugged, there will be kernel panic.
remote:
remote:          This is the result of Software Clocks not setting up their parents
remote:          correctly when booting via kexec. The prevents the parent
remote:          clocks of the sw clock from being enabled. This is happening because
remote:          kexec uses /proc/device-tree to reconstruct the FDT that is used
remote:          to boot the new kernel and this changes the original node order to be
remote:          alphabetical and the clock software depends on the parent clock nodes
remote:          being defined before the software clock. This change removes the
remote:          ordering restriction and allows sw clocks and parents to be
remote:          defined in any order.

remote:          net: dsa: bcm_sf2: Fix ageing conditions and operation
remote:
remote:          The comparison check between cur_hw_state and hw_state is currently
remote:          invalid because cur_hw_state is right shifted by G_MISTP_SHIFT, while
remote:          hw_state is not, so we end-up comparing bits 2:0 with bits 7:5, which is
remote:          going to cause an additional aging to occur. Fix this by not shifting
remote:          cur_hw_state while reading it, but instead, mask the value with the
remote:          appropriately shitfted bitmask.
remote:
remote:          The other problem with the fast-ageing process is that we did not set
remote:          the EN_AGE_DYNAMIC bit to request the ageing to occur for dynamically
remote:          learned MAC addresses. Finally, write back 0 to the FAST_AGE_CTRL
remote:          register to avoid leaving spurious bits sets from one operation to the
remote:          other.

remote:
remote:          Configuring the ethtool tx-frames property, which translates into N
remote:          packets before a TX interrupt is the simplest configuration scheme
remote:          because it requires no locking neither at the softare nor hardware
remote:          level, and is completely indepedent from the link speed. Since ethtool
remote:          does not allow per-tx queue coalescing parameters, we apply the same
remote:          setting to any transmit queue.
remote:
remote:          We can no longer enable the BDONE/PDONE interrupts as those would fire
remote:          for each packet/buffer received, which would defeat the MBDONE interrupt
remote:          purpose. The MBDONE interrupt is guaranteed to correspond to a
remote:          PDONE/BDONE interrupt when the threshold is set to 1, but offers
remote:          interrupt coalescing when the value is > 1.
remote:
remote:          Since the HW is configured to generate an interrupt when the ring
remote:          becomes emtpy, we have to deny any timeout/timer settings coming from
remote:          user-space to indicate we can only generate an interrupt very <N>
remote:          packets.
remote:
remote:          While we are at it, fix the DMA_INTR_THRESHOLD_MASK value which was off
remote:          by one bit (0xff vs. 0x1ff).

remote:          driver, where it was necessary because that would handle multiple spi_transfers
remote:          at a time and it was important to know when to break.  Now that we're using
remote:          transfer_one(), remove the unnecessary test.
remote:
remote:          Also, it was misleading to have a function named ..._update_parms when calling
remote:          it one way was actually just a test that wouldn't actually update any
remote:          parameters.  Now it becomes a single-purpose function that fits its name.

remote:          spi: brcmstb-mspi: fix completion timeout
remote:
remote:          We had the timeout set as msecs_to_jiffies(10), and were seeing bad timeout
remote:          values.  Now, with CONFIG_HZ=100, a jiffy is ~10 ms, so msecs_to_jiffies(10)
remote:          ends up returning 1 jiffy.  Unfortunately, if I understand correctly, waiting
remote:          for a single jiffy isn't that effective, because it means you could be waiting
remote:          for basically no time at all, depending on when your operation is scheduled to
remote:          occur.  This matches up with what we were seeing, which is that when several
remote:          SPI writes were scheduled in sequence, it would consistently fail after several
remote:          ms, which suggests the following:
remote:
remote:          time
remote:           |
remote:           v                                       tick occurs

remote:          Increase the timeout to 11 (which will be rounded up to 2 jiffies) seems to
remote:          make this problem go away entirely, which further supports this idea.  But
remote:          looking at a sampling of SPI bus drivers in drivers/spi/ suggests that it's
remote:          probably just best to set a larger timeout value, so let's set it to HZ (will
remote:          result in 1s timeout).

remote:          spi: Add Broadcom MSPI controller driver
remote:
remote:          Some comments that are NOT FOR UPSTREAM, explaining what was changed from
remote:          original spi-brcmstb driver:
remote:
remote:          - removes BSPI support (this should be made into a proper spi-nor framework
remote:            driver), which means we don't poke EBI CS anymore
remote:          - removes EBI CS switching, which is only needed for memory mapping
remote:          - add write lock field for use with BSPI
remote:          - use the BCM7120 L2 driver instead of twiddling L2 directly from here
remote:          - get rid of useless debug prints and unused fields
remote:          - use newer transfer_one spi core API
remote:          - use spi_transfer_is_last() instead of directly checking transfer_list
remote:          - remove unnecessary state and locking
remote:          - add timeout to wait_for_completion
remote:          - request mspi_done IRQ
remote:
remote:          Changes added by Gregory and Florian:
remote:
remote:          Until the spi-nor framework is used to allow using BSPI with this
remote:          driver, the spi-brcmstb driver, if enabled, should be used for HIF SPI
remote:          (MSPI+BSPI) instead.  This will then only be used when the compatible
remote:          string is "brcm,spi-brcmstb-mspi".

remote:          BCMGENET: Fix error path in bcmgenet_mii_new_dt_init()
remote:
remote:          In case we parse the 'phy-mode' property, that is, of_get_phy_mode() returned
remote:          an error, we will take the "out" label, call mdiobus_unregister(), and then
remote:          return an error code. bcmgenet_mii_init() will take the "out" label as well and
remote:          call bcmgenet_mii_exit() calling bcmgenet_mii_free() which calls
remote:          mdiobus_unregister() a second time.
remote:
remote:          We would hit the BUG() condition on the mii_bus structure 'state' member and
remote:          crash the kernel.
remote:
remote:          Fix this by removing the mdiobus_unregister() call in
remote:          bcmgenet_mii_new_dt_init() since it duplicates the existing error path.

remote:          watchdog_dev: Change watchdog naming to be consistent with alias
remote:
remote:          There isn't a way to differentiate multiple watchdogs because
remote:          the naming scheme is done through watchdog_dev. This change uses
remote:          the alias ID for the watchdog name. This makes it easy to cross
remote:          reference the watchdog with the device tree alias so we can know
remote:          which watchdog we are using.
remote:
remote:          If no alias is defined, the watchdog will use the default naming
remote:          scheme.

remote:          ARM: v7 setup function should invalidate L1 cache
remote:
remote:          All ARMv5 and older CPUs invalidate their caches in the early assembly
remote:          setup function, prior to enabling the MMU.  This is because the L1
remote:          cache should not contain any data relevant to the execution of the
remote:          kernel at this point; all data should have been flushed out to memory.
remote:
remote:          This requirement should also be true for ARMv6 and ARMv7 CPUs - indeed,
remote:          these typically do not search their caches when caching is disabled (as
remote:          it needs to be when the MMU is disabled) so this change should be safe.
remote:
remote:          ARMv7 allows there to be CPUs which search their caches while caching is
remote:          disabled, and it's permitted that the cache is uninitialised at boot;
remote:          for these, the architecture reference manual requires that an
remote:          implementation specific code sequence is used immediately after reset
remote:          to ensure that the cache is placed into a sane state.  Such
remote:          functionality is definitely outside the remit of the Linux kernel, and
remote:          must be done by the SoC's firmware before _any_ CPU gets to the Linux
remote:          kernel.
remote:
remote:          Changing the data cache clean+invalidate to a mere invalidate allows us
remote:          to get rid of a lot of platform specific hacks around this issue for
remote:          their secondary CPU bringup paths - some of which were buggy.

remote:          mm: some brcmstb_get_page() cleanup
remote:
remote:          brcmstb_get_page() does not actually use its vma argument, so get rid of that.
remote:          We still need to check that we actually have a vma beforehand though.  Also,
remote:          the next_page label in __get_user_pages() (GUP) already handles accounting so we'd
remote:          like to just jump there and not duplicate the logic.  While looking at that, I
remote:          realized that we were unnecessarily re-finding the current vma every iteration,
remote:          which should only be necessary when first calling GUP or when crossing a vma
remote:          bound, so by changing to jump to next_page and instead also calling
remote:          brcmstb_get_page() in the inner loop, that should help to optimize GUP for BMEM
remote:          and CMA.

remote:          libata: skip debounce delay on link resume
remote:
remote:          The link resume logic uses a 200msec delay while debouncing
remote:          the SControl register. The rationale behind that delay is
remote:          to accomodate some PHYs that behave badly if their SStatus/
remote:          SControl registers are pounded immediately on resume.
remote:          The Broadcom STB SATA PHY does not seem to have this issue.
remote:          This patch introduces a new link flag that allows platforms
remote:          to skip the debounce delay if it isn't needed.

remote:          1. GENET MAC detects MoCA link state change and issues UMAC_IRQ_LINK_UP
remote:             or UMAC_IRQ_LINK_DOWN interrupt.
remote:          2. Link up/down interrupt is processed in bcmgenet_irq_task(), which
remote:             calls phy_mac_interrupt().
remote:          3. phy_mac_interrupt() updates the fixed PHY phydev->link and kicks
remote:             the PHY state machine.
remote:          4. PHY state machine proceeds to read the fixed PHY link status
remote:             register.
remote:          5. When the fixed PHY link status register is being read, the new
remote:             function bcmgenet_fixed_phy_link_update() gets called. It copies
remote:             the fixed PHY phydev->link value to the fixed PHY status->link.
remote:          6. PHY state machine receives the new link state of the fixed PHY.
remote:          7. MoCA fixed PHY link state now correctly reflects the real MoCA
remote:             hardware link state.

remote:          drivers: ata: wake port before DMA stop for ALPM
remote:
remote:          The AHCI driver code stops and starts port DMA engines at will
remote:          without considering the power state of the particular port. The
remote:          AHCI specification isn't very clear on how to handle this scenario,
remote:          leaving implementation open to interpretation.
remote:
remote:          Broadcom's STB SATA host controller is unable to handle port DMA
remote:          controller restarts when the port in question is in low power mode.
remote:          When a port enters partial or slumber mode, it's PHY is powered down.
remote:          When a controller restart is requested, the controller's internal
remote:          state machine expects the PHY to be brought back up by software which
remote:          never happens in this case, resulting in failures.
remote:
remote:          To avoid this situation, logic is added to manually wake up the port
remote:          just before it's DMA engine is stopped, if the port happens to be in
remote:          a low power state. HBA initiated power management ensures that the port
remote:          eventually returns to it's configured low power state, when the link is
remote:          idle (as per the conditions listed in the spec). A new host flag is also
remote:          added to ensure this logic is only exercised for hosts with the above
remote:          limitation.

remote:          soc: brcmstb: wktmr: Implement persistent clock for sleep
remote:
remote:          In order to have the core kernel timekeeping code to work and be able to
remote:          account for time spent during sleep states, implement a persistent clock device
remote:          which utilizes the WKTMR.
remote:
remote:          ARM offers the ability to dynamically register such a device using
remote:          register_persistent_clock(), so we utilize this to provide a working
remote:          implementation.
remote:
remote:          While at it, fix the typo on the prescaler register define.
remote:
remote:          Note that the wktmr is now a singleton, and we will return -EBUSY if we find an
remote:          existing wake-timer instance while probing.

remote:          irqchip: bcm7120-l2: Fix interrupt status reads for multiple L1
remote:
remote:          Our irq-bcm7120-l2 interrupt controller driver utilizes the same handler
remote:          function for the different parent interrupts it services: UPG_MAIN, UPG_BSC for
remote:          instance.
remote:
remote:          The problem is that function reads the IRQSTAT register which can combine
remote:          interrupt causes for different parent interrupts, such that we can end-up in the
remote:          following situation:
remote:
remote:          - CPU takes an interrupt
remote:          - bcm7120_l2_intc_irq_handle() reads IRQSTAT
remote:          - generic_handle_irq() is invoked
remote:          - there are still pending interrupts flagged in IRQSTAT from a different parent
remote:          - handle_bad_irq() is invoked
remote:
remote:          In order to fix this, make sure that we always mask IRQSTAT with the
remote:          appropriate bits that correspond go the parent interrupt source this is coming
remote:          from. To simplify things, associate an unique structure per parent interrupt
remote:          handler to avoid multiplying the number of lookups.
remote:
remote:          While at it, remove the unused 'gc' argument from bcm7120_l2_intc_irq_handle().

remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit f668f074ff58dea540d83bbed1b2c1171b0dd764]
remote:
remote:          This check may be prone to race conditions, e.g.
remote:
remote:          1) Some external event (e.g. GPIO level) causes an IRQ to become pending
remote:          2) Peripheral asserts the L2 IRQ
remote:          3) CPU takes an interrupt
remote:          4) The event from #1 goes away
remote:          5) bcm7120_l2_intc_irq_handle() reads back a 0 status
remote:
remote:          Unlike the hardware supported by brcmstb-l2, the bcm7120-l2 controller
remote:          does not latch the IRQ status.  Bits can change if the inputs to the
remote:          controller change.  Also, do_bad_IRQ() is an ARM-specific macro.
remote:
remote:          So let's just nuke it.

remote:          We are currently doing a full PHY initialization and starting the PHY state
remote:          machine during bcmgenet_mii_init() which is executed in the probe function.
remote:          This is convenient to determine whether we can attach to a proper PHY device
remote:          but comes with expense of spending up to 10ms per MDIO transaction, which
remote:          slows things down.
remote:
remote:          This also creates a situation where we end-up attaching twice to the PHY,
remote:          which is not quite correct either.
remote:
remote:          Fix this by moving bcmgenet_mii_probe() into bcmgenet_open().

remote:          BCMGENET: Use correct dev_id for free_irq
remote:
remote:          bcmgenet_open()'s error path calls free_irq() with a dev_id argument different
remote:          from the one we used to call request_irq() with, this will make us trip over

remote:          BCMGENET: Remove excessive PHY reset
remote:
remote:          We are currently issuing multiple PHY resets during a suspend/resume,
remote:          first during bcmgenet_power_up() which does a hardware reset, then a
remote:          software reset by calling bcmgenet_mii_reset(). This is both unnecessary
remote:          and can take as long as 10ms per MDIO transactions while we re-apply
remote:          workarounds because we do not yet have MDIO interrupts enabled.
remote:
remote:          phy_resume() takes care of re-apply our workarounds in case we need any,
remote:          and bcmgenet_power_up() does a PHY hardware reset, all of this is more
remote:          than enough to guarantee that the PHY operates correctly.

remote:          mmc: Some Micron eMMC devices cause reboot to hang
remote:
remote:          When using eMMC as the boot device, some Micron eMMC devices will
remote:          cause reboot to hang. This is a result of the eMMC device not going
remote:          into boot mode after the hardware sends CMD0 to reset the eMMC
remote:          device. This only happens if the kernel driver sends CMD5 (SLEEP_WAKE),
remote:          to put the device into sleep state, before restarting the system.
remote:          The fix is to add a quirk that avoids sending the SLEEP command
remote:          and to use MMC_FIXUP to set the quirk for these Micron devices.

remote:          net: phy: mdio-bcm-unimac: workaround initial read failures for integrated PHYs
remote:
remote:          All BCM7xxx integrated Gigabit PHYs have an issue in their MDIO
remote:          management controller which will make the initial read or write to them
remote:          to fail and return 0xffff. This is a real issue as the typical first
remote:          thing we do is read from MII_PHYSID1 and MII_PHYSID2 from get_phy_id()
remote:          to register a driver for these PHYs.
remote:
remote:          Coupled with the workaround in drivers/net/phy/bcm7xxx.c, this
remote:          workaround for the MDIO bus controller consists in scanning the list of
remote:          PHYs to do this initial read workaround for as part of the MDIO bus
remote:          reset routine which is invoked prior to mdiobus_scan().
remote:
remote:          Once we have a proper PHY driver/device registered, all workarounds are
remote:          located there (e.g: power management suspend/resume calls).

remote:          NOTES:
remote:          - "dual" mode is broken on the 7439bx but will be fixed in

remote:
remote:          When moving the default reservation logic, I accidentally left out a
remote:          crucial change for the 512M DRAM case: alignment fixing.  While this
remote:          should _hopefully_ only be required for 512M, we actually want to be
remote:          pageblock-aligned all the time (well, it's not pageblock for transparent
remote:          hugepages, but it's easier to just say pageblock), and it's certainly
remote:          possible that some memory reservations might not be so aligned.  So just
remote:          do the alignment all of the time like we were doing in cma_driver
remote:          before.
remote:
remote:          Tested on 73649a0 (512M RAM) that default boot-time CMA reserve works
remote:          and 'cmatool unittest' passes all tests after this change.

remote:          net: dsa: bcm_sf2: do not use indirect reads and writes for 7445E0
remote:
remote:          7445E0 contains an ECO (HW7445-1526) which disconnected the internal SF2
remote:          pseudo-PHY which was known to conflict with the external pseudo-PHY of
remote:          BCM53125 switches. This motivated the need to utilize the internal SF2
remote:          MDIO controller via indirect register reads/writes to control external
remote:          Broadcom switches due to this address conflict (both responded at
remote:          address 30d).
remote:
remote:          For 7445E0, the internal pseudo-PHY of the SF2 switch got disconnected,
remote:          and as a consequence this prevents the internal SF2 MDIO bus controller
remote:          from reading data (reads back everything as 0) since the MDI line is
remote:          tied low.
remote:
remote:          Fix this by making the indirect register reads and writes conditional to
remote:          7445D0, on 7445E0 we can utilize the SWITCH_MDIO controller (backed by
remote:          mdio-unimac and not the DSA created slave MII bus).

remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit ab6016e0c134c3a564e6750f5b246ba17ada4686]
remote:
remote:          Some Ethernet PHY devices/switches may not properly release the MDIO bus
remote:          during turn-around time, and fail to drive it low, which can be seen by
remote:          some controllers as a read failure, while the data clocked in is still
remote:          correct.
remote:
remote:          Add a boolean property "broken-turn-around" which is parsed by the
remote:          generic MDIO bus probing code and will set the corresponding bit in the
remote:          MDIO bus phy_ignore_ta_mask bitmask for MDIO bus drivers to utilize that
remote:          information.

remote:          gpio: brcmstb: support wakeup from S5 cold boot
remote:
remote:          For wake from S5, we need to:
remote:          - register a reboot handler
remote:          - set wakeup capability before requesting IRQ so wakeup count is incremented
remote:          - mask all GPIO IRQs and clear any pending interrupts during driver probe to
remote:            since no driver will yet be registered to handle any IRQs carried over from
remote:            boot at that time, and it's possible that the booted kernel does not request
remote:            the same IRQ anyway.
remote:
remote:          This means that /sys/.../power/wakeup_count is valid at boot time,
remote:          and we can properly account for S5 wakeup stats. e.g.:
remote:
remote:            ### After waking from S5 from a GPIO key

remote:          gpio: brcmstb: switch to using gpiolib irqchip helpers
remote:
remote:          Switches the BRCMSTB UPG GIO driver to using the gpiolib irqchip helpers
remote:          in the gpiolib core.  This lets us reduce the amount of duplicated code
remote:          a bit.  For this to work, the irq setup function is changed to be called
remote:          once per bank instead of once per device.
remote:
remote:          What wasn't obvious to me before: you can have multiple chained irqchips
remote:          and associated IRQ domains for a single parent IRQ, and as long as the
remote:          xlate function is written correctly, a GPIO IRQ request end up checking
remote:          the correct domain and will get associated with the correct IRQ.  What
remote:          helps make this clear is to read
remote:            drivers/gpio/gpiolib-of.c:
remote:             - of_gpiochip_find_and_xlate()
remote:             - of_get_named_gpiod_flags()
remote:            drivers/gpio/gpiolib.c:

remote:          after allocating the priv struct to both avoid the null pointer dereference

remote:          gpio: Fix potential NULL handler data in chained irqchip handler
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 324b0398781e7afb846378dd2d8a4374faaf236b]
remote:
remote:          There is possibility with misconfigured pins that interrupt occurs instantly
remote:          after setting irq_set_chained_handler() in gpiochip_set_chained_irqchip().
remote:          Now if handler gets called before irq_set_handler_data() the handler gets
remote:          NULL handler data.
remote:
remote:          Fix this by moving irq_set_handler_data() call before
remote:          irq_set_chained_handler() in gpiochip_set_chained_irqchip().

remote:
remote:          Another feature that is duplicated in a number of GPIO irqchips
remote:          is that these cascades IRQs are assigned their own lock class
remote:          so as to avoid warnings about lockdep recursions. Do this also
remote:          in the generic GPIO irqchip helpers for smooth transition to

remote:          gpio: support threaded interrupts in irqchip helpers
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 1c8732bb0355b929b09173464cdca7df4d516f89]
remote:
remote:          Some off-chip GPIO expanders need to be communicated by I2C or
remote:          SPI traffic, but may still support IRQs. By the sleeping nature
remote:          of such buses, such IRQ handlers need to be threaded. Support
remote:          such handlers in the gpiochip irqchip helpers by flagging IRQs
remote:          as threaded if the .can_sleep property of the gpiochip is
remote:          true.
remote:
remote:          Helpfully deny registration of chained IRQ handlers if the
remote:          .can_sleep property is set, as such chips will invariably need
remote:          a nested handler rather than a chained handler.

remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 1425052097b53de841e064dc190a9009480c208c]
remote:
remote:          This provides a function gpiochip_irqchip_add() to set
remote:          up an irqchip for a GPIO controller, and a function
remote:          gpiochip_set_chained_irqchip() to chain it to a parent
remote:          irqchip.
remote:
remote:          Most GPIOs are of the type where a number of lines form
remote:          a cascaded interrupt controller chained onto
remote:          the primary system interrupt controller (or further down the
remote:          chain) so let's add this helper and factor the code to
remote:          request the lines to be used as IRQs, the .to_irq() function
remote:          and the irqdomain into the core as well.

remote:          genirq: Provide irq_request/release_resources chip callbacks
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit f438acdf3de8f19ad2789eddbf52e3280292759b]
remote:
remote:          For certain irq types, e.g. gpios, it's necessary to request resources
remote:          before starting up the irq.
remote:
remote:          This might fail so we cannot use the irq_startup() callback because we
remote:          might call the irq_set_type() callback before that which does not make
remote:          sense when the resource is not available. Calling irq_startup() before
remote:          irq_set_type() can lead to spurious interrupts which is not desired
remote:          either.

remote:          gpiolib: Allow GPIO chips to request their own GPIOs
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 77c2d7929d7d7f0e391b17f85d2d954912ed0590]
remote:
remote:          Sometimes it is useful to allow GPIO chips themselves to request GPIOs they
remote:          own through gpiolib API. One use case is ACPI ASL code that should be able
remote:          to toggle GPIOs through GPIO operation regions.
remote:
remote:          We can't use gpio_request() because it will pin the module to the kernel
remote:          forever (it calls try_module_get()). To solve this we move module refcount
remote:          manipulation to gpiod_request() and let __gpiod_request() handle the actual
remote:          request. This changes the sequence a bit as now try_module_get() is called
remote:          outside of gpio_lock (I think this is safe, try_module_get() handles
remote:          serialization it needs already).
remote:
remote:          Then we provide gpiolib internal functions gpiochip_request/free_own_desc()
remote:          that do the same as gpio_request() but don't manipulate module refrence
remote:          count. This allows the GPIO chip driver to request and free descriptors it
remote:          owns without being pinned to the kernel forever.

remote:          gpiolib: add gpiochip_get_desc() driver function
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit bb1e88ccb771492ac908ac295ec135efa1d53093]
remote:
remote:          Some drivers dealing with a gpio_chip might need to act on its
remote:          descriptors directly; one example is pinctrl drivers that need to lock a
remote:          GPIO for being used as IRQ using gpiod_lock_as_irq().
remote:
remote:          This patch exports a gpiochip_get_desc() function that returns the
remote:          GPIO descriptor at the requested index. It also sweeps the
remote:          gpio_to_chip() function out of the consumer interface since any holder
remote:          of a gpio_chip reference can manipulate its GPIOs way beyond what a
remote:          consumer should be allowed to do.
remote:
remote:          As a result, gpio_chip is not visible anymore to simple GPIO consumers.

remote:          soc: brcmstb: Add memory API for middleware
remote:
remote:          Adds a way for the Broadcom middleware (nexus) to be able to get the
remote:          information it needs about how memory is placed on the system.  This is done by
remote:          the ability to populate a struct brcmstb_memory with info on
remote:          - PA ranges for each memory controller
remote:          - static "bmem" ranges
remote:          - dynamic (CMA in this case) reserved ranges
remote:          - reserved areas unavailable to middleware
remote:
remote:          We use libfdt to read the device tree for info on what memory should actually
remote:          be visible.
remote:
remote:          Moves phys_addr_to_memc from cma_driver to memory API and renames as
remote:          brcmstb_memory_phys_addr_to_memc, since it is now shared by cma_driver and this
remote:          code.
remote:
remote:          This also adds to the platform reserve code in order to grab the memblock
remote:          reserve info during early boot, as the memblock info isn't discarded later.

remote:
remote:          Changes include:
remote:
remote:          - Place in drivers/soc/brcmstb
remote:          - Use new Kconfig entry to enable: CONFIG_BRCMSTB_BMEM
remote:          - No default allocation (must specify everything manually).
remote:          - Does not assume that address 0 means "put at end of memc0".  It'll put the
remote:            reserved regions wherever you want.
remote:          - No safeties: you can reserve all of lowmem if you want to watch the kernel
remote:            crash and burn.
remote:          - No special handling for memc1: not needed since we're not overriding the
remote:            default free_bootmem like on mips, but rather providing a saner means via
remote:            bmem_reserve which uses memblock and will be called from arch code.
remote:          - MAX_BMEM_REGIONS bumped from 4 to 8.
remote:          - Uses phys_addr_t instead of unsigned long so we can use >32-bit addresses
remote:            where appropriate.
remote:          - Don't BUG on pud_none in bmem_get_page because we've seen this unnecessarily
remote:            crashes the kernel on ARM when called from GUP (see SWLINUX-3350)
remote:          - Use phys_addr_t for bmem functions

remote:

remote:          BCM_SYSPORT_STAT_MIB_RX and BCM_SYSPORT_STAT_MIB_TX. These statistics are read
remote:          from the hardware MIB counters, such that bcm_sysport_update_mib_counters() was
remote:          trying to read from a non-existing MIB offset for these counters.
remote:
remote:          Fix this by introducing a special type: BCM_SYSPORT_STAT_SOFT, similar to

remote:          BCMSYSPORT: rewrite bcm_sysport_rx_refill
remote:
remote:          Currently, bcm_sysport_desc_rx() calls bcm_sysport_rx_refill() at the end of Rx
remote:          packet processing loop, after the current Rx packet has already been passed to
remote:          napi_gro_receive(). However, bcm_sysport_rx_refill() might fail to allocate a new
remote:          Rx skb, thus leaving a hole on the Rx queue where no valid Rx buffer exists.
remote:
remote:          To eliminate this situation:
remote:
remote:          1. Rewrite bcm_sysport_rx_refill() to retain the current Rx skb on the
remote:          Rx queue if a new replacement Rx skb can't be allocated and DMA-mapped.
remote:          In this case, the data on the current Rx skb is effectively dropped.
remote:
remote:          2. Modify bcm_sysport_desc_rx() to call bcm_sysport_rx_refill() at the
remote:          top of Rx packet processing loop, so that the new replacement Rx skb is
remote:          already in place before the current Rx skb is processed.
remote:
remote:          This is loosely inspired from d6707bec5986 ("net: bcmgenet: rewrite
remote:          bcmgenet_rx_refill()")

remote:          - 320 "peripheral" GPIOs
remote:          - 5*32 = 160 UPG GPIOs (counting unused lines, which do get counted)
remote:          - 2*32 = 64 UPG AON GPIOs (counting unused lines)
remote:          Total: 544
remote:
remote:          I suspect that the upper limit will only need to be higher in the future, so
remote:          set it to 1024.

remote:          gpio: brcmstb: Allow GPIOs to be wakeup sources
remote:
remote:          Several drivers (e.g. gpio-keys) allow for GPIOs to be configured as wakeup
remote:          sources, and this GPIO controller supports that through a separate interrupt
remote:          path.
remote:
remote:          The de-facto standard DT property "wakeup-source" is checked, since that
remote:          indicates whether the GPIO controller hardware can wake.  Uses the
remote:          IRQCHIP_MASK_ON_SUSPEND irq_chip flag because UPG GIO doesn't have any of its
remote:          own wakeup source configuration.

remote:          gpio: clamp returned values to the boolean range
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 23600969ff137cf4c3bc9098f77e381de334e3f7]
remote:
remote:          Nothing prevents GPIO drivers from returning values outside the
remote:          boolean range, and as it turns out a few drivers are actually doing so.
remote:          These values were passed as-is to unsuspecting consumers and created
remote:          confusion.
remote:
remote:          This patch makes the internal _gpiod_get_raw_value() function return a
remote:          bool, effectively clamping the GPIO value to the boolean range no
remote:          matter what the driver does.
remote:
remote:          While we are at it, we also change the value parameter of
remote:          _gpiod_set_raw_value() to bool type before drivers start doing funny
remote:          things with it as well.
remote:
remote:          Another way to fix this would be to change the prototypes of the driver
remote:          interface to use bool directly, but this would require a huge
remote:          cross-systems patch so this simpler solution is preferred.
remote:
remote:          Changes since v1:
remote:          - Change local variable type to bool as well, use boolean values in
remote:            code
remote:          - Also change prototype of open drain/open source setting functions
remote:            since they are only called from _gpiod_set_raw_value()
remote:
remote:          This probably calls for a larger booleanization of gpiolib, but let's
remote:          keep that for a latter change - right now we need to address the issue
remote:          of non-boolean values returned by drivers.

remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 3be2a49e5c08d268f8af0dd4fe89a24ea8cdc339]
remote:
remote:          Some Ethernet MACs have a "fixed link", and are not connected to a
remote:          normal MDIO-managed PHY device. For those situations, a Device Tree
remote:          binding allows to describe a "fixed link" using a special PHY node.
remote:
remote:          This patch adds:
remote:
remote:           * A documentation for the fixed PHY Device Tree binding.
remote:
remote:           * An of_phy_is_fixed_link() function that an Ethernet driver can call
remote:             on its PHY phandle to find out whether it's a fixed link PHY or
remote:             not. It should typically be used to know if
remote:             of_phy_register_fixed_link() should be called.
remote:
remote:           * An of_phy_register_fixed_link() function that instantiates the
remote:             fixed PHY into the PHY subsystem, so that when the driver calls
remote:             of_phy_connect(), the PHY device associated to the OF node will be
remote:             found.
remote:
remote:          These two additional functions also support the old fixed-link Device
remote:          Tree binding used on PowerPC platforms, so that ultimately, the
remote:          network device drivers for those platforms could be converted to use
remote:          of_phy_is_fixed_link() and of_phy_register_fixed_link() instead of
remote:          of_phy_connect_fixed_link(), while keeping compatibility with their
remote:          respective Device Tree bindings.

remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit a75951217472c522c324adb0a4de3ba69d656ef5]
remote:
remote:          The existing fixed_phy_add() function has several drawbacks that
remote:          prevents it from being used as is for OF-based declaration of fixed
remote:          PHYs:
remote:
remote:           * The address of the PHY on the fake bus needs to be passed, while a
remote:             dynamic allocation is desired.
remote:
remote:           * Since the phy_device instantiation is post-poned until the next
remote:             mdiobus scan, there is no way to associate the fixed PHY with its
remote:             OF node, which later prevents of_phy_connect() from finding this
remote:             fixed PHY from a given OF node.
remote:
remote:          To solve this, this commit introduces fixed_phy_register(), which will
remote:          allocate an available PHY address, add the PHY using fixed_phy_add()
remote:          and instantiate the phy_device structure associated with the provided
remote:          OF node.

remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 9b744942290c168287013f0a19ff7392f65c8107]
remote:
remote:          Until now, the fixed_phy_add() function was taking as argument
remote:          'phy_id', which was used both as the PHY address on the fake fixed
remote:          MDIO bus, and as the PHY id, as available in the MII_PHYSID1 and
remote:          MII_PHYSID2 registers. However, those two informations are completely
remote:          unrelated.
remote:
remote:          This patch decouples them. The PHY id of fixed PHYs is hardcoded to be
remote:          0x0. Ideally, a really reserved value would be nicer, but there
remote:          doesn't seem to be an easy of making sure a dummy value can be
remote:          assigned to the Linux kernel for such usage.
remote:
remote:          The PHY address remains passed by the caller of phy_fixed_add().

remote:
remote:          The has_cma variable is used to determine whether there is a need to account
remote:          for CMA in the OOM analysis (i.e. whether it has to worry about movable vs

remote:          net: dsa: bcm_sf2: propagate carrier down states
remote:
remote:          There is currently a complex race condition with fixed PHYs utilizing a
remote:          link_update callback in how they propagate link down notifications. We may, or
remote:          may not, under certain circumstances reach the PHY_NOLINK state in the PHY state
remote:          machine, which means that we will never call netif_carrier_off() for that
remote:          interface. This is a problem for link monitoring applications since they will
remote:          never learn about the "NO-CARRIER" flag.
remote:
remote:          Fix that by explicitly calling netif_carrier_off() in our link_update callback
remote:          to propagate carrier state changes accordingly.

remote:          gpio: Add GPIO support for Broadcom STB SoCs
remote:
remote:          This adds support for the GPIO IP "UPG GIO" used on Broadcom STB SoCs
remote:          (BCM7XXX and some others).  Uses basic_mmio_gpio to instantiate a
remote:          gpio_chip for each bank.  The driver assumes that it handles the base
remote:          set of GPIOs on the system and that it can start its numbering sequence
remote:          from 0, so any GPIO expanders used with it must dynamically assign GPIO
remote:          numbers after this driver has finished registering its GPIOs.
remote:
remote:          Does not implement the interrupt-controller portion yet, will be done in a

remote:

remote:          thermal: brcmstb_thermal: add of-thermal and hardware trigger support
remote:
remote:          We can make use of the upstream thermal device tree bindings to
remote:          configure trip points for us. We can also make use of the proposed
remote:          .set_trips() callback, which was backported in a previous patch (not
remote:          upstream yet) to utilize our high/low interrupts most economically.
remote:
remote:          Because we supplied some basic support for temperature readins
remote:          previously, where this driver registered its own standalone thermal zone
remote:          (without using the of-thermal framework), I have migrated the existing
remote:          support into a fall-back 'brcmstb_thermal_zone_probe()' option. This
remote:          can help transition between device trees that have the 'thermal-zones'
remote:          node set up and those that don't. We should schedule this to be removed
remote:          quickly in a future release.

remote:          thermal: user_space: add trip point number and temperature to uevent data
remote:
remote:          Now that the thermal core supplies trip notifications when
remote:          *crossing* a trip point, and only for that single trip point, it is
remote:          useful to provide this information in the uevent metadata. That way, a
remote:          user-space governor can figure out this information directly, without
remote:          any guessing. This also eliminates a potential race, where the
remote:          temperature may have changed between the time a hardware trip was fired
remote:          and the time it is received by the governor.
remote:
remote:          This patch should be submitted upstream. It's possible this will not
remote:          suit the general needs of other thermal users, and so we might consider
remote:          integrating this directly into brcmstb_thermal instead.

remote:          thermal: report trips only when crossed
remote:
remote:          For some reason, the existing infrastructure will notify *all* trip
remote:          points whenever any driver calls thermal_zone_device_update_temp(). This
remote:          is unfortunate for users of hardware-backed trip points, since that

remote:
remote:          Instead, let's only call handle_thermal_trip() when we've crossed a

remote:
remote:          This should be submitted upstream, possibly with some rework to make it
remote:          more generically useful. If nothing else, it might generate some
remote:          explanation as to why the trip point notifications are currently so

remote:          thermal: add thermal_zone_device_update_temp() API
remote:
remote:          Allow drivers to report a particular update temperature.
remote:
remote:          This is important for hardware-supported trip points. On such hardware,

remote:
remote:          (1) hardware interrupt

remote:
remote:          Between (1) and (3), the temperature might change a bit.
remote:
remote:          So, rather than add in caching to the sensor driver to record the
remote:          temperature at (1), just allow the driver to pass it directly through.

remote:          thermal: Add support for hardware-tracked trip points
remote:
remote:          [Backported preliminary patch. See thread:
remote:          http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.power-management.general/58483/]
remote:
remote:          This adds support for hardware-tracked trip points to the device tree
remote:          thermal sensor framework.
remote:
remote:          The framework supports an arbitrary number of trip points. Whenever
remote:          the current temperature is updated, the trip points immediately
remote:          below and above the current temperature are found. A .set_trips
remote:          callback is then called with the temperatures. If there is no trip
remote:          point above or below the current temperature, the passed trip
remote:          temperature will be ULONG_MAX or 0 respectively. In this callback,
remote:          the driver should program the hardware such that it is notified
remote:          when either of these trip points are triggered. When a trip point
remote:          is triggered, the driver should call `thermal_zone_device_update'
remote:          for the respective thermal zone. This will cause the trip points
remote:          to be updated again.
remote:
remote:          If .set_trips is not implemented, the framework behaves as before.
remote:
remote:          This patch is based on an earlier version from Mikko Perttunen

remote:

remote:
remote:          Let the core test for -ENOSYS from these callbacks and treat it like
remote:          if the callbacks were not present.
remote:
remote:          This allows of-thermal to always set the sensor related callbacks and

remote:
remote:          [Backported preliminary patch. See thread:

remote:
remote:          commit e6e238c38 (thermal: sysfs: Add a new sysfs node emul_temp for
remote:          thermal emulation)  promised not to emulate critical temperatures,
remote:          but the check for critical temperatures is broken in multiple ways:
remote:
remote:          - The code should only accept an emulated temperature when the emulated
remote:            temperature is lower than the critical temperature. Instead the code
remote:            accepts an emulated temperature whenever the real temperature is lower
remote:            than the critical temperature. This makes no sense and trying to
remote:            emulate a temperature higher than the critical temperature halts the
remote:            system.
remote:          - When trying to emulate a higher-than-critical temperature we should either
remote:            limit the emulated temperature to the maximum non critical temperature
remote:            or refuse to emulate this temperature. Instead the code just silently
remote:            ignores the emulated temperature and continues with the real temperature.
remote:
remote:          This patch moves the test for illegal emulated temperature to the sysfs
remote:          write function so that we can properly refuse illegal temperatures here.
remote:          Trying to write illegal temperatures results in an error message. While
remote:          at it use IS_ENABLED() instead of #ifdefs.

remote:          thermal: remove useless call to thermal_zone_device_set_polling
remote:
remote:          [Backported preliminary patch. See thread:
remote:          http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.power-management.general/58483/]
remote:
remote:          When the thermal zone has no get_temp callback then thermal_zone_device_register()
remote:          calls thermal_zone_device_set_polling() with a polling delay of 0. This
remote:          only cancels the poll_queue. Since the poll_queue hasn't been scheduled this
remote:          is a no-op. Remove it.

remote:          thermal: Introduce dummy functions when thermal is not defined

remote:          When CONFIG_THERMAL is not enabled, it is better to introduce

remote:          thermal: Fix cdev registration with THERMAL_NO_LIMIT on 64bit
remote:
remote:          The size of unsigned long varies between 32 and 64 bit systems while
remote:          the size of phandle arguments is always 32 bits per parameter.
remote:
remote:          On 64-bit systems, cooling devices registered via of-thermal apis fail
remote:          to bind when the min/max cooling state is specified as
remote:          THERMAL_NO_LIMIT (-1UL) as there is a mis-match between the value read
remote:          from the device tree (32bit) and the pre-processor define (64bit).
remote:
remote:          As we're unlikely to need cooling states larger than 32 bits, and for
remote:          consistency with the size of phandle arguments, explicitly limit
remote:          THERMAL_NO_LIMIT to 32 bits.

remote:          thermal: of: improve of-thermal sensor registration API
remote:
remote:          Different drivers request API extensions in of-thermal. For this reason,
remote:          additional callbacks are required to fit the new drivers needs.
remote:
remote:          The current API implementation expects the registering sensor driver
remote:          to provide a get_temp and get_trend callbacks as function parameters.
remote:          As the amount of callbacks is growing, this patch changes the existing
remote:          implementation to use a .ops field to hold all the of thermal callbacks
remote:          to sensor drivers.
remote:
remote:          This patch also changes the existing of-thermal users to fit the new
remote:          API design. No functional change is introduced in this patch.

remote:          thermal: step_wise: fix: Prevent from binary overflow when trend is dropping
remote:
remote:          It turns out that some boards can have instance->lower greater than 0 and
remote:          when thermal trend is dropping it results with next_target equal to -1.
remote:
remote:          Since the next_target is defined as unsigned long it is interpreted as
remote:          0xFFFFFFFF and larger than instance->upper.
remote:          As a result the next_target is set to instance->upper which ramps up to
remote:          maximal cooling device target when the temperature is steadily decreasing.

remote:          thermal: add support to disable thermal zone from DTS
remote:
remote:          Add support to check status of the thermal zone before registering the
remote:          zone. This will help on disabling some non-existing thermal zone from
remote:          the top level DTS file out of common dtsi thermalzone file.
remote:
remote:          For example,
remote:          we have 3 platforms almost same but thermal zones on this platform are
remote:          little bit different. Platform 1 and 2 have three thermal zones and
remote:          platform 3 has two thermal zones. To avoid duplication of the thermal
remote:          zones entries on each DTS file of platforms,we created one common
remote:          dtsi file for thermal zone and included this dtsi file from these
remote:          3 platform's top level dts file.
remote:
remote:          On common thermal zone com dtsi file, all thermal zone are enabled and
remote:          need to disable one of thermal zone on platform 3 dts file. For this, we
remote:          just added entry status = "disabled" for that thermal zone on platform 3
remote:          dts file and along with this change to make it work.
remote:
remote:          This way, we reuse the common file and control the enable/disable of the
remote:          thermal zone from top level dts file.

remote:          clk: divider: handle integer overflow when dividing large clock rates
remote:
remote:          [Backported version of patch from:
remote:          http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.power-management.general/59004
remote:          Some discussion at:
remote:          lkml.kernel.org/g/20150413201433.GQ32500@ld-irv-0074]
remote:
remote:          On 32-bit architectures, 'unsigned long' (the type used to hold clock
remote:          rates, in Hz) is often only 32 bits wide. DIV_ROUND_UP() (as used in,
remote:          e.g., commit b11d282dbea2 "clk: divider: fix rate calculation for
remote:          fractional rates") can yield an integer overflow on clock rates that are
remote:          not (by themselves) too large to fit in 32 bits, because it performs
remote:          addition before the division. See for example:
remote:
remote:            DIV_ROUND_UP(3000000000, 1500000000) = (3.0G + 1.5G - 1) / 1.5G
remote:                                                 = OVERFLOW / 1.5G
remote:
remote:          This patch fixes such cases by always promoting the dividend to 64-bits
remote:          (unsigned long long) before doing the division. While this patch does
remote:          not resolve the issue with large clock rates across the common clock
remote:          framework nor address the problems with doing full 64-bit arithmetic on
remote:          a 32-bit architecture, it does fix some issues seen when using clock
remote:          dividers on a 3GHz reference clock to produce a 1.5GHz CPU clock for an
remote:          ARMv7 Brahma B15 SoC.

remote:          clk: clk-divider: pass width to _register_divider()
remote:
remote:          _register_divider() expects a mask width parameter, not the mask itself.
remote:
remote:          Also add extra sanity checking on the device tree, since we really
remote:          expect a contiguous mask, packed to the low bit position.
remote:
remote:          Note that the code in question has not been merged upstream; the
remote:          original code was just grabbed off the mailing list.
remote:
remote:          Perhaps for an upstream submission, this property should be reworked as
remote:          a 'mask-width' parameter instead? It's not clear to me what we would do
remote:          with a non-contiguous mask, as this binding (and driver) was not really
remote:          designed for it. And I don't think such hardware exists, at least not in
remote:          a sane world.

remote:          ARM: Introduce CPU_METHOD_OF_DECLARE() for cpu hotplug/smp
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 6c3ff8b11a16ec69199ab85b74a5fae6d9c59db7]
remote:
remote:          The goal of multi-platform kernels is to remove the need for mach
remote:          directories and machine descriptors. To further that goal,
remote:          introduce CPU_METHOD_OF_DECLARE() to allow cpu hotplug/smp
remote:          support to be separated from the machine descriptors.
remote:          Implementers should specify an enable-method property in their
remote:          cpus node and then implement a matching set of smp_ops in their
remote:          hotplug/smp code, wiring it up with the CPU_METHOD_OF_DECLARE()
remote:          macro. When the kernel is compiled we'll collect all the
remote:          enable-method smp_ops into one section for use at boot.
remote:
remote:          At boot time we'll look for an enable-method in each cpu node and
remote:          try to match that against all known CPU enable methods in the
remote:          kernel. If there are no enable-methods in the cpu nodes we
remote:          fallback to the cpus node and try to use any enable-method found
remote:          there. If that doesn't work we fall back to the old way of using
remote:          the machine descriptor.

remote:          [Upstream submission: https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/4/8/754 ]
remote:
remote:          get_symbol_str() was assuming that symbols would only have a single

remote:          This is not true, and one current example is FRAME_POINTER which is

remote:          ARM: mmu: Bump default vmalloc to 744 MiB for BRCMSTB with >=1 GiB RAM
remote:
remote:          If >= 1 GiB RAM is present (or more than one meminfo bank exists), this
remote:          increases the vmalloc area to 744 MiB and thus reduces the default amount of
remote:          lowmem to 256 MiB, which is basically all we were getting anyway with
remote:          cma_driver putting all other memory in CMA regions.  This should eliminate what
remote:          has been referred to as the "CMA barrier" (the split in memory regions on the
remote:          first memory controller because of the lowmem/highmem boundary) without
remote:          negatively impacting the actual amount of memory on the system (kernel
remote:          allocations mostly couldn't use lowmem in CMA regions anyway).
remote:
remote:          It'd be nice if we could just have more lowmem so as not to help alleviate
remote:          lowmem exhaustion, but that's a problem for another day.
remote:
remote:          For systems with < 1GB RAM, there was no CMA barrier, so we keep the default
remote:          vmalloc size the same.
remote:
remote:          This will probably need updating if there are ever any boards with 768 MiB RAM.
remote:          Also, the function relies on meminfo so will need to be updated for 3.16+, which
remote:          no longer uses meminfo.

remote:          brcmstb_gisb_arb_probe() which now calls a function annotated with __init, so
remote:          this one must also be annotated with __init.
remote:
remote:          In order to avoid introducing another section mismatch, call
remote:          platform_driver_probe() manually and remove the .probe assignment from
remote:          brcmstb_gisb_arb_driver, this is very similar to what
remote:          drivers/pci/host/pci-imx6.c does since we basically have the same constraints
remote:          here.

remote:
remote:          Commit 44127b771d9c31 ("bus: add Broadcom GISB bus arbiter timeout/error
remote:          handler") added everything that is required to register an ARM fault handler
remote:          for imprecise external aborts, except that there is nothing calling this
remote:          currently.
remote:
remote:          We do not need to export that specific function and have to update
remote:          arch/arm/mach-bcm/brcmstb.c to call it, simply, register the fault handler
remote:          during the probe() function of the driver.

remote:          pci: dynamically allocate brcm_pcie structure
remote:
remote:          Before we kept a statically array of two PCIe structures which
remote:          seemed enough at the time.  With this commit we keep the array,
remote:          but make it an array of pointers that will contain dynmically
remote:          allocated PCIe structures.  In a future commit we will dispose
remote:          of the array entirely and use a list.
remote:
remote:          In the process of making this change, we initialize the
remote:          hw_data.private_data structure so that it points to an array
remote:          of our PCIe pointers.  As such, we can use the pci_sys_data
remote:          structure to recover the PCIe pointer of interest.  This
remote:          obsoletes the awkward bus range counting that was done for
remote:          each RC.

remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 803dd9c77ac3a08958535f2a1ad5890104e2c235]
remote:
remote:          As part of a call to ndo_close() a netdevice driver may call
remote:          phy_disconnect() -> phy_detach() -> phy_suspend(), such that the PHY is
remote:          suspsended at this point and a netdevice driver may clock gate the
remote:          backing peripheral providing MDIO bus accessses as well.
remote:
remote:          Update mdio_bus_phy_may_suspend() to return whether a PHY is allowed to
remote:          be suspended and conversely resumed if and only if it was not previously
remote:          suspended before while it is currently in detached (netdev pointer is
remote:          NULL) state.
remote:
remote:          This fixes bus errors seen during S2/S3 suspend/resume cycles for
remote:          netdevice drivers such as GENET which clock gates the entire Ethernet
remote:          MAC, including the MDIO bus block.

remote:          PM / sleep: add configurable delay for pm_test
remote:
remote:          [Queued upstream]
remote:
remote:          When CONFIG_PM_DEBUG=y, we provide a sysfs file (/sys/power/pm_test) for
remote:          selecting one of a few suspend test modes, where rather than entering a
remote:          full suspend state, the kernel will perform some subset of suspend
remote:          steps, wait 5 seconds, and then resume back to normal operation.
remote:
remote:          This mode is useful for (among other things) observing the state of the
remote:          system just before entering a sleep mode, for debugging or analysis
remote:          purposes. However, a constant 5 second wait is not sufficient for some
remote:          sorts of analysis; for example, on an SoC, one might want to use
remote:          external tools to probe the power states of various on-chip controllers
remote:          or clocks.
remote:
remote:          This patch turns this 5 second delay into a configurable module
remote:          parameter, so users can determine how long to wait in this
remote:          pseudo-suspend state before resuming the system.
remote:
remote:          Example (wait 30 seconds);
remote:
remote:            # echo 30 > /sys/module/suspend/parameters/pm_test_delay
remote:            # echo core > /sys/power/pm_test
remote:            # time echo mem  > /sys/power/state
remote:            ...
remote:            [   17.583625] suspend debug: Waiting for 30 second(s).

remote:          spi-brcmstb: Fix BUG() when crossing 4MB boundaries
remote:
remote:          On BSPI <= V3 controllers, the hardware remaps the address bits in a way
remote:          that can cause trouble for transfers that cross a 4MB boundary.  For such
remote:          transfers, we currently BUG() out.  Change the driver behavior so that it
remote:          falls back gracefully to MSPI instead.
remote:
remote:          On BSPI >= V4 controllers, the hardware allows us to disable the remapping
remote:          logic.  So disable remapping during initialization, and disable the driver
remote:          code that modified and checked the address.

remote:            *No*, not enough memory at time of OOM.
remote:
remote:            Possible causes of OOM:
remote:            - If this took some time to fail, could be a memory leak in a kernel module.
remote:            - lowmem_reserve might be too high. Try tweaking /proc/sys/vm/lowmem_reserve_ratio.
remote:            - May not have enough lowmem outside of a CMA region. You may need to decrease the size of a region in lowmem.

remote:
remote:          The Broadcom Brahma-B15 readahead cache needs to be disabled,
remote:          respectively re-enable during a CPU hotplug. In case we were not to do,
remote:          CPU hotplug would occasionally fail with random crashes when a given CPU
remote:          exits the coherency domain while the RAC is still enabled, as it would
remote:          get stale data from the RAC.
remote:
remote:          In order to avoid adding any specific B15 readahead-cache awareness to
remote:          arch/arm/mach-bcm/hotplug-brcmstb.c we use a CPU notifier which allows
remote:          us to catch CPU hotplug events and disable/flush enable the RAC
remote:          accordingly.

remote:
remote:          If we detect that we are running on a Broadcom Brahma-B15 CPU, and

remote:
remote:          If CONFIG_CACHE_B15_RAC is enabled, but we are not running on a Broadcom

remote:          v7_cache_fns with the cost of a small test. If CONFIG_CACHE_B15_RAC is
remote:          disabled, there is no cost and we just use the regular v7_cache_fns.

remote:          RM: Add Broadcom Brahma-B15 readahead cache support
remote:
remote:          This patch adds support for the Broadcom Brahma-B15 CPU readahead cache
remote:          controller. This cache controller sits between the L2 and the memory bus
remote:          and its purpose is to provide a friendler burst size towards the DDR
remote:          interface than the native cache line size.
remote:
remote:          The readahead cache is mostly transparent, except for
remote:          flush_kern_cache_all, flush_kern_cache_louis and flush_icache_all, which
remote:          is precisely what we are overriding here.
remote:
remote:          The readahead cache only intercepts reads, not writes, as such, some
remote:          data can remain stale in any of its buffers, such that we need to flush
remote:          it, which is an operation that needs to happen in a particular order:
remote:
remote:          - disable the readahead cache
remote:          - flush it
remote:          - call the appropriate cache-v7.S function
remote:          - re-enable
remote:
remote:          This patch tries to minimize the impact to the cache-v7.S file by only
remote:          providing a stub in case CONFIG_CACHE_B15_RAC is enabled (default for
remote:          ARCH_BRCMSTB since it is the current user).

remote:          BCMGENET: Properly disable password matching when requested
remote:
remote:          Ever since the BCMGENET driver was introduced, we had a small issue in the

remote:
remote:          Once we ask the driver to match against a magic packet with a password, we will

remote:          PM: hack around a BSP race condition
remote:
remote:          Changes to the PM code have uncovered that if the host is too fast at

remote:          might not ever respond properly, causing a timeout.
remote:
remote:          According to the BSP firmware team, a few milliseconds (~2-3) wait after
remote:          the clock stop command should be sufficient to fend of such races within
remote:          the BSP. Let's add the hack.

remote:          The leave operation is fairly similar, special care must be taken to
remote:          make sure that port leaving the bridging is not removing itself from its
remote:          own VLAN control register.
remote:
remote:          Since the various BR_* states apply directly to our HW semantics, we just
remote:          need to translate these constants into their corresponding HW settings,
remote:          and voila!
remote:
remote:          We make sure to trigger a fast-ageing process for ports that are
remote:          joining/leaving the bridge and transition from incompatible states, this
remote:          is equivalent to triggering an ARL flush for that port.

remote:          net: dsa: bcm_sf2: fix 64-bits register reads
remote:
remote:          Reading 64-bits register was not working because we inverted the steps
remote:          between reading the lower 32-bits of the register and reading the upper
remote:          32-bits. Swapping these operations is how the HW guarantees that 64-bits
remote:          reads are latched correctly. We only have a handful of 64-bits registers
remote:          for now, mostly MIB counters, so the impact is low.

remote:          net: dsa: allow switch drivers to implement bridge ndo operations
remote:
remote:          Allows switch drivers to implement ndo_br_join, ndo_br_leave and
remote:          ndo_br_set_state network device operations and have those be propagated
remote:          down to the switch driver.
remote:
remote:          DSA will resolve which switch ports are currently bridge port members as
remote:          some Switch hardware/drivers need to know about that to limit the
remote:          register programming to just the relevant registers (especially for slow
remote:          MDIO buses).
remote:
remote:          We also take care of setting the correct STP state when slave network
remote:          devices are brought up/down while being bridge members.
remote:
remote:          Finally, when a port is leaving the bridge, we make sure we set in
remote:          BR_STATE_FORWARDING state, otherwise the bridge layer would leave it
remote:          disabled as a result of having left the bridge.

remote:           [Upstream submission https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/2/24/745]

remote:
remote:          For example, if cma->order_per_bit=1, cma->base_pfn=

remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit e48322abb061d75096fe52d71886b237e7ae7bfb]
remote:
remote:          When the system boots up, in the dmesg logs we can see the memory
remote:          statistics along with total reserved as below.  Memory: 458840k/458840k
remote:          available, 65448k reserved, 0K highmem
remote:
remote:          When CMA is enabled, still the total reserved memory remains the same.
remote:          However, the CMA memory is not considered as reserved.  But, when we see
remote:          /proc/meminfo, the CMA memory is part of free memory.  This creates
remote:          confusion.  This patch corrects the problem by properly subtracting the
remote:          CMA reserved memory from the total reserved memory in dmesg logs.

remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit b5be83e308f70e16c63c4e520ea7bb03ef57c46f]
remote:
remote:          The alignment in cma_alloc() was done w.r.t. the bitmap.  This is a
remote:          problem when, for example:
remote:
remote:          - a device requires 16M (order 12) alignment
remote:          - the CMA region is not 16 M aligned
remote:
remote:          In such a case, can result with the CMA region starting at, say,
remote:          0x2f800000 but any allocation you make from there will be aligned from
remote:          there.  Requesting an allocation of 32 M with 16 M alignment will result
remote:          in an allocation from 0x2f800000 to 0x31800000, which doesn't work very
remote:          well if your strange device requires 16M alignment.
remote:
remote:          Change to use bitmap_find_next_zero_area_off() to account for the
remote:          difference in alignment at reserve-time and alloc-time.

remote:

remote:
remote:          Having test_pages_isolated failure message as a warning confuses users
remote:          into thinking that it is more serious than it really is.  In reality, if
remote:          called via CMA, allocation will be retried so a single
remote:          test_pages_isolated failure does not prevent allocation from succeeding.
remote:
remote:          Demote the warning message to an info message and reformat it such that
remote:          the text "failed" does not appear and instead a less worrying "PFNS
remote:          busy" is used.
remote:
remote:          This message is trivially reproducible on a 10GB x86 machine on 3.16.y

remote:          tmon: tui: fixup windowing calculations
remote:
remote:          The number of rows in the dialog vary according to the number of cooling
remote:          devices. However, some of the windowing computations were assuming a
remote:          fixed number of rows. This computation is OK when we have between 4 and
remote:          9 cooling devices (and they wrap to the next column), but with fewer
remote:          devices, we end up printing off the end of the window.
remote:
remote:          This unifies the row computation into a single function and uses that
remote:          throughout the TUI code. This also accounts for increasing the number of
remote:          rows when there are more than 9 total cooling devices.

remote:          CMA: use total cma pages for adjust_managed_cma_page_count
remote:
remote:          In the previous commit ("CMA: aggressively allocate the pages on CMA reserved
remote:          memory when not used" by Joonsoo Kim), CMA allocation is changed to be based on
remote:          the total number of "normal" managed pages and the number of managed (aka not
remote:          CMA-allocated) CMA pages.  This was intended to be used in conjunction with a
remote:          commit "CMA: always treat free cma pages as non-free on watermark checking"[1].
remote:          However, including that change results in a severe limitation that cannot be
remote:          used on brcmstb with the current setup: it restricts the amount of CMA region
remote:          memory to be less than or equal to to one-half of the system memory.
remote:
remote:          Rather than applying that change, this alters the heuristic from the
remote:          previous commit: we change the definition of "normal" manages in a zone from
remote:
remote:            total pages - managed (unallocated) CMA pages - high_wmark_pages(zone)
remote:
remote:          to
remote:
remote:            total pages - total CMA pages
remote:
remote:          This eliminates the need to handle determining whether an allocation should
remote:          succeed or fail based on the watermark check, and allows for memory in CMA
remote:          regions to be used for movable allocations even if there isn't any extra room
remote:          to migrate them out of the CMA region.
remote:
remote:          The obvious and rather large caveat is that in the event of a CMA allocation
remote:          actually requiring that space, there might not be enough space available to
remote:          which to move the used pages in the CMA region, resulting in potentially
remote:          catastrophic CMA allocation failures.  Whereas Joonsoo's commit prevents that
remote:          by design but restricts CMA usage, this maintains flexibility for CMA region
remote:          use but leaves it to the system designer to handle CMA allocation failure.

remote:          CMA: aggressively allocate the pages on CMA reserved memory when not used
remote:
remote:          [Retrieved from
remote:          https://github.com/JoonsooKim/linux/commit/33a0416b3ac1cd7c88e6b35ee61b4a81a7a14afc]
remote:
remote:          CMA is introduced to provide physically contiguous pages at runtime.
remote:          For this purpose, it reserves memory at boot time. Although it reserve
remote:          memory, this reserved memory can be used for movable memory allocation
remote:          request. This usecase is beneficial to the system that needs this CMA
remote:          reserved memory infrequently and it is one of main purpose of
remote:          introducing CMA.
remote:
remote:          But, there is a problem in current implementation. The problem is that
remote:          it works like as just reserved memory approach. The pages on CMA reserved
remote:          memory are hardly used for movable memory allocation. This is caused by
remote:          combination of allocation and reclaim policy.
remote:
remote:          The pages on CMA reserved memory are allocated if there is no movable
remote:          memory, that is, as fallback allocation. So the time this fallback
remote:          allocation is started is under heavy memory pressure. Although it is under
remote:          memory pressure, movable allocation easily succeed, since there would be
remote:          many pages on CMA reserved memory. But this is not the case for unmovable
remote:          and reclaimable allocation, because they can't use the pages on CMA
remote:          reserved memory. These allocations regard system's free memory as
remote:          (free pages - free CMA pages) on watermark checking, that is, free
remote:          unmovable pages + free reclaimable pages + free movable pages. Because
remote:          we already exhausted movable pages, only free pages we have are unmovable
remote:          and reclaimable types and this would be really small amount. So watermark
remote:          checking would be failed. It will wake up kswapd to make enough free
remote:          memory for unmovable and reclaimable allocation and kswapd will do.
remote:          So before we fully utilize pages on CMA reserved memory, kswapd start to
remote:          reclaim memory and try to make free memory over the high watermark. This
remote:          watermark checking by kswapd doesn't take care free CMA pages so many
remote:          movable pages would be reclaimed. After then, we have a lot of movable
remote:          pages again, so fallback allocation doesn't happen again. To conclude,
remote:          amount of free memory on meminfo which includes free CMA pages is moving
remote:          around 512 MB if I reserve 512 MB memory for CMA.
remote:
remote:          I found this problem on following experiment.
remote:
remote:          4 CPUs, 1024 MB, VIRTUAL MACHINE
remote:          make -j16
remote:
remote:          CMA reserve:            0 MB            512 MB
remote:          Elapsed-time:           225.2           472.5
remote:          Average-MemFree:        322490 KB       630839 KB
remote:
remote:          To solve this problem, I can think following 2 possible solutions.
remote:          1. allocate the pages on CMA reserved memory first, and if they are
remote:             exhausted, allocate movable pages.
remote:          2. interleaved allocation: try to allocate specific amounts of memory
remote:             from CMA reserved memory and then allocate from free movable memory.
remote:
remote:          I tested #1 approach and found the problem. Although free memory on
remote:          meminfo can move around low watermark, there is large fluctuation on free
remote:          memory, because too many pages are reclaimed when kswapd is invoked.
remote:          Reason for this behaviour is that successive allocated CMA pages are
remote:          on the LRU list in that order and kswapd reclaim them in same order.
remote:          These memory doesn't help watermark checking from kwapd, so too many
remote:          pages are reclaimed, I guess.
remote:
remote:          So, I implement #2 approach.
remote:          One thing I should note is that we should not change allocation target
remote:          (movable list or CMA) on each allocation attempt, since this prevent
remote:          allocated pages to be in physically succession, so some I/O devices can
remote:          be hurt their performance. To solve this, I keep allocation target
remote:          in at least pageblock_nr_pages attempts and make this number reflect
remote:          ratio, free pages without free CMA pages to free CMA pages. With this
remote:          approach, system works very smoothly and fully utilize the pages on
remote:          CMA reserved memory.
remote:
remote:          Following is the experimental result of this patch.

remote:          There is no difference if we don't have CMA reserved memory (0 MB case).

remote:

remote:          So generally we can see latency increase. Ratio of this increase
remote:          is rather big - up to 70%. But, under the heavy workload, it shows
remote:          latency decrease - up to 55%. This may be worst-case scenario, but
remote:          reducing it would be important for some system, so, I can say that
remote:          this patch have advantages and disadvantages in terms of latency.
remote:
remote:          Although I think that this patch is right direction for CMA, there is
remote:          side-effect in following case. If there is small memory zone and CMA
remote:          occupys most of them, LRU for this zone would have many CMA pages. When
remote:          reclaim is started, these CMA pages would be reclaimed, but not counted
remote:          for watermark checking, so too many CMA pages could be reclaimed
remote:          unnecessarily. Until now, this can't happen because free CMA pages aren't
remote:          used easily. But, with this patch, free CMA pages are used easily so
remote:          this problem can be possible. I will handle it on another patchset
remote:          after some investigating.
remote:
remote:          v2:
remote:            - In fastpath, just replenish counters. Calculation is done whenver
remote:              CMA area is varied
remote:
remote:          v3:
remote:            - Use unsigned type in adjust_managed_cma_page_count() (per Gioh)
remote:            - Fix +/- count when calling adjust_managed_cma_page_count() (per Gioh)
remote:            - Instead of implementing __rmqueue_cma() which has another
remote:              __rmqueue_smallest(), choose_rmqueue_migratetype() is implemented to
remote:              change original migratetype to MIGRATE_CMA according to criteria. It
remote:              helps not to violate layering. (per Minchan in offline discussion)

remote:          CMA: remove redundant retrying code in __alloc_contig_migrate_range
remote:
remote:          [Upstream submission (not yet accepted) https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/5/28/113]
remote:
remote:          We already have retry logic in migrate_pages(). It does retry 10 times.
remote:          So if we keep this retrying code in __alloc_contig_migrate_range(), we
remote:          would try to migrate some unmigratable page in 50 times. There is just one
remote:          small difference in -ENOMEM case. migrate_pages() don't do retry
remote:          in this case, however, current __alloc_contig_migrate_range() does. But,
remote:          I think that this isn't problem, because in this case, we may fail again
remote:          with same reason.

remote:          mm/page_alloc: restrict max order of merging on isolated pageblock
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 3c605096d3158216ba9326a16266f6ba128c2c8d]
remote:
remote:          Current pageblock isolation logic could isolate each pageblock
remote:          individually.  This causes freepage accounting problem if freepage with
remote:          pageblock order on isolate pageblock is merged with other freepage on
remote:          normal pageblock.  We can prevent merging by restricting max order of
remote:          merging to pageblock order if freepage is on isolate pageblock.
remote:
remote:          A side-effect of this change is that there could be non-merged buddy
remote:          freepage even if finishing pageblock isolation, because undoing
remote:          pageblock isolation is just to move freepage from isolate buddy list to
remote:          normal buddy list rather than to consider merging.  So, the patch also
remote:          makes undoing pageblock isolation consider freepage merge.  When
remote:          un-isolation, freepage with more than pageblock order and it's buddy are
remote:          checked.  If they are on normal pageblock, instead of just moving, we
remote:          isolate the freepage and free it in order to get merged.

remote:          mm/page_alloc: add freepage on isolate pageblock to correct buddy list
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 51bb1a4093cc68bc16b282548d9cee6104be0ef1]
remote:
remote:          In free_pcppages_bulk(), we use cached migratetype of freepage to
remote:          determine type of buddy list where freepage will be added.  This
remote:          information is stored when freepage is added to pcp list, so if
remote:          isolation of pageblock of this freepage begins after storing, this
remote:          cached information could be stale.  In other words, it has original
remote:          migratetype rather than MIGRATE_ISOLATE.
remote:
remote:          There are two problems caused by this stale information.
remote:
remote:          One is that we can't keep these freepages from being allocated.
remote:          Although this pageblock is isolated, freepage will be added to normal
remote:          buddy list so that it could be allocated without any restriction.  And
remote:          the other problem is incorrect freepage accounting.  Freepages on
remote:          isolate pageblock should not be counted for number of freepage.
remote:
remote:          Following is the code snippet in free_pcppages_bulk().
remote:
remote:              /* MIGRATE_MOVABLE list may include MIGRATE_RESERVEs */
remote:              __free_one_page(page, page_to_pfn(page), zone, 0, mt);
remote:              trace_mm_page_pcpu_drain(page, 0, mt);
remote:              if (likely(!is_migrate_isolate_page(page))) {
remote:                  __mod_zone_page_state(zone, NR_FREE_PAGES, 1);
remote:                  if (is_migrate_cma(mt))
remote:                      __mod_zone_page_state(zone, NR_FREE_CMA_PAGES, 1);
remote:              }
remote:
remote:          As you can see above snippet, current code already handle second
remote:          problem, incorrect freepage accounting, by re-fetching pageblock
remote:          migratetype through is_migrate_isolate_page(page).
remote:
remote:          But, because this re-fetched information isn't used for
remote:          __free_one_page(), first problem would not be solved.  This patch try to
remote:          solve this situation to re-fetch pageblock migratetype before
remote:          __free_one_page() and to use it for __free_one_page().
remote:
remote:          In addition to move up position of this re-fetch, this patch use
remote:          optimization technique, re-fetching migratetype only if there is isolate
remote:          pageblock.  Pageblock isolation is rare event, so we can avoid
remote:          re-fetching in common case with this optimization.
remote:
remote:          This patch also correct migratetype of the tracepoint output.

remote:          mm/page_alloc: fix incorrect isolation behavior by rechecking migratetype
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit ad53f92eb416d81e469fa8ea57153e59455e7175]
remote:
remote:          Before describing bugs itself, I first explain definition of freepage.
remote:
remote:           1. pages on buddy list are counted as freepage.
remote:           2. pages on isolate migratetype buddy list are *not* counted as freepage.
remote:           3. pages on cma buddy list are counted as CMA freepage, too.
remote:
remote:          Now, I describe problems and related patch.
remote:
remote:          Patch 1: There is race conditions on getting pageblock migratetype that
remote:          it results in misplacement of freepages on buddy list, incorrect
remote:          freepage count and un-availability of freepage.
remote:
remote:          Patch 2: Freepages on pcp list could have stale cached information to
remote:          determine migratetype of buddy list to go.  This causes misplacement of
remote:          freepages on buddy list and incorrect freepage count.
remote:
remote:          Patch 4: Merging between freepages on different migratetype of
remote:          pageblocks will cause freepages accouting problem.  This patch fixes it.
remote:
remote:          Without patchset [3], above problem doesn't happens on my CMA allocation
remote:          test, because CMA reserved pages aren't used at all.  So there is no
remote:          chance for above race.
remote:
remote:          With patchset [3], I did simple CMA allocation test and get below
remote:          result:
remote:
remote:           - Virtual machine, 4 cpus, 1024 MB memory, 256 MB CMA reservation
remote:           - run kernel build (make -j16) on background
remote:           - 30 times CMA allocation(8MB * 30 = 240MB) attempts in 5 sec interval
remote:           - Result: more than 5000 freepage count are missed
remote:
remote:          With patchset [3] and this patchset, I found that no freepage count are
remote:          missed so that I conclude that problems are solved.
remote:
remote:          On my simple memory offlining test, these problems also occur on that
remote:          environment, too.
remote:
remote:          This patch (of 4):
remote:
remote:          There are two paths to reach core free function of buddy allocator,
remote:          __free_one_page(), one is free_one_page()->__free_one_page() and the
remote:          other is free_hot_cold_page()->free_pcppages_bulk()->__free_one_page().
remote:          Each paths has race condition causing serious problems.  At first, this
remote:          patch is focused on first type of freepath.  And then, following patch
remote:          will solve the problem in second type of freepath.
remote:
remote:          In the first type of freepath, we got migratetype of freeing page
remote:          without holding the zone lock, so it could be racy.  There are two cases
remote:          of this race.
remote:
remote:           1. pages are added to isolate buddy list after restoring orignal
remote:              migratetype
remote:
remote:              CPU1                                   CPU2
remote:
remote:              get migratetype => return MIGRATE_ISOLATE
remote:              call free_one_page() with MIGRATE_ISOLATE
remote:
remote:                                          grab the zone lock
remote:                                          unisolate pageblock
remote:                                          release the zone lock
remote:
remote:              grab the zone lock
remote:              call __free_one_page() with MIGRATE_ISOLATE
remote:              freepage go into isolate buddy list,
remote:              although pageblock is already unisolated
remote:
remote:          This may cause two problems.  One is that we can't use this page anymore
remote:          until next isolation attempt of this pageblock, because freepage is on
remote:          isolate buddy list.  The other is that freepage accouting could be wrong
remote:          due to merging between different buddy list.  Freepages on isolate buddy
remote:          list aren't counted as freepage, but ones on normal buddy list are
remote:          counted as freepage.  If merge happens, buddy freepage on normal buddy
remote:          list is inevitably moved to isolate buddy list without any consideration
remote:          of freepage accouting so it could be incorrect.
remote:
remote:           2. pages are added to normal buddy list while pageblock is isolated.
remote:              It is similar with above case.
remote:
remote:          This also may cause two problems.  One is that we can't keep these
remote:          freepages from being allocated.  Although this pageblock is isolated,
remote:          freepage would be added to normal buddy list so that it could be
remote:          allocated without any restriction.  And the other problem is same as
remote:          case 1, that it, incorrect freepage accouting.
remote:
remote:          This race condition would be prevented by checking migratetype again
remote:          with holding the zone lock.  Because it is somewhat heavy operation and
remote:          it isn't needed in common case, we want to avoid rechecking as much as
remote:          possible.  So this patch introduce new variable, nr_isolate_pageblock in
remote:          struct zone to check if there is isolated pageblock.  With this, we can
remote:          avoid to re-check migratetype in common case and do it only if there is
remote:          isolated pageblock or migratetype is MIGRATE_ISOLATE.  This solve above
remote:          mentioned problems.
remote:
remote:          Changes from v3:
remote:          Add one more check in free_one_page() that checks whether migratetype is
remote:          MIGRATE_ISOLATE or not. Without this, abovementioned case 1 could happens.

remote:          mm: cma: Ensure that reservations never cross the low/high mem boundary
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 16195ddd4ebcc10c30b2f232f8e400df8d464380]
remote:
remote:          Commit 95b0e655f914 ("ARM: mm: don't limit default CMA region only to
remote:          low memory") extended CMA memory reservation to allow usage of high
remote:          memory. It relied on commit f7426b983a6a ("mm: cma: adjust address limit
remote:          to avoid hitting low/high memory boundary") to ensure that the reserved
remote:          block never crossed the low/high memory boundary. While the
remote:          implementation correctly lowered the limit, it failed to consider the
remote:          case where the base..limit range crossed the low/high memory boundary
remote:          with enough space on each side to reserve the requested size on either
remote:          low or high memory.
remote:
remote:          Rework the base and limit adjustment to fix the problem. The function
remote:          now starts by rejecting the reservation altogether for fixed
remote:          reservations that cross the boundary, tries to reserve from high memory
remote:          first and then falls back to low memory.

remote:

remote:
remote:          The fixed parameter to cma_declare_contiguous() tells the function

remote:          base address, which must never be considered as a fixed value.
remote:
remote:          Part of the implementation correctly checks both fixed and base != 0,
remote:          but two locations check the fixed value only. Set fixed to false when
remote:          base is 0 to fix that and simplify the code.

remote:          mm/cma: fix cma bitmap aligned mask computing
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 68faed630fc151a7a1c4853df00fb3dcacf782b4]
remote:
remote:          The current cma bitmap aligned mask computation is incorrect.  It could
remote:          cause an unexpected alignment when using cma_alloc() if the wanted align
remote:          order is larger than cma->order_per_bit.
remote:
remote:          Take kvm for example (PAGE_SHIFT = 12), kvm_cma->order_per_bit is set to
remote:          6.  When kvm_alloc_rma() tries to alloc kvm_rma_pages, it will use 15 as
remote:          the expected align value.  After using the current implementation however,
remote:          we get 0 as cma bitmap aligned mask other than 511.
remote:
remote:          This patch fixes the cma bitmap aligned mask calculation.

remote:          mm: cma: adjust address limit to avoid hitting low/high memory boundary
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit f7426b983a6a353cf21e5733e84458219c4a817e]
remote:
remote:          Russell King recently noticed that limiting default CMA region only to low
remote:          memory on ARM architecture causes serious memory management issues with
remote:          machines having a lot of memory (which is mainly available as high
remote:          memory).  More information can be found the following thread:
remote:          http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.ports.arm.kernel/348441/
remote:
remote:          Those two patches removes this limit letting kernel to put default CMA
remote:          region into high memory when this is possible (there is enough high memory
remote:          available and architecture specific DMA limit fits).
remote:
remote:          This should solve strange OOM issues on systems with lots of RAM (i.e.
remote:          >1GiB) and large (>256M) CMA area.
remote:
remote:          This patch (of 2):
remote:
remote:          Automatically allocated regions should not cross low/high memory boundary,
remote:          because such regions cannot be later correctly initialized due to spanning
remote:          across two memory zones.  This patch adds a check for this case and a
remote:          simple code for moving region to low memory if automatically selected
remote:          address might not fit completely into high memory.

remote:          CMA: generalize CMA reserved area management functionality
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit a254129e8686bff7a340b58f35241b04927e81c0]
remote:
remote:          Currently, there are two users on CMA functionality, one is the DMA
remote:          subsystem and the other is the KVM on powerpc.  They have their own code
remote:          to manage CMA reserved area even if they looks really similar.  From my
remote:          guess, it is caused by some needs on bitmap management.  KVM side wants
remote:          to maintain bitmap not for 1 page, but for more size.  Eventually it use
remote:          bitmap where one bit represents 64 pages.
remote:
remote:          When I implement CMA related patches, I should change those two places
remote:          to apply my change and it seem to be painful to me.  I want to change
remote:          this situation and reduce future code management overhead through this
remote:          patch.
remote:
remote:          This change could also help developer who want to use CMA in their new
remote:          feature development, since they can use CMA easily without copying &
remote:          pasting this reserved area management code.
remote:
remote:          In previous patches, we have prepared some features to generalize CMA
remote:          reserved area management and now it's time to do it.  This patch moves
remote:          core functions to mm/cma.c and change DMA APIs to use these functions.
remote:
remote:          There is no functional change in DMA APIs.

remote:          cma: add placement specifier for "cma=" kernel parameter
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 5ea3b1b2f8ad9162684431ce6188102ca4c64b7a]
remote:
remote:          Currently, "cma=" kernel parameter is used to specify the size of CMA,
remote:          but we can't specify where it is located.  We want to locate CMA below
remote:          4GB for devices only supporting 32-bit addressing on 64-bit systems
remote:          without iommu.
remote:
remote:          This enables to specify the placement of CMA by extending "cma=" kernel
remote:          parameter.
remote:
remote:          Examples:
remote:           1. locate 64MB CMA below 4GB by "cma=64M@0-4G"
remote:           2. locate 64MB CMA exact at 512MB by "cma=64M@512M"
remote:
remote:          Note that the DMA contiguous memory allocator on x86 assumes that
remote:          page_address() works for the pages to allocate.  So this change requires
remote:          to limit end address of contiguous memory area upto max_pfn_mapped to
remote:          prevent from locating it on highmem area by the argument of
remote:          dma_contiguous_reserve().

remote:          cma: Remove potential deadlock situation
remote:
remote:          [Upstream commit 7ee793a62fa8c544f8b844e6e87b2d8e8836b219]
remote:
remote:          CMA locking is currently very coarse. The cma_mutex protects both
remote:          the bitmap and avoids concurrency with alloc_contig_range. There
remote:          are several situations which may result in a deadlock on the CMA
remote:          mutex currently, mostly involving AB/BA situations with alloc and
remote:          free. Fix this issue by protecting the bitmap with a mutex per CMA
remote:          region and use the existing mutex for protecting against concurrency
remote:          with alloc_contig_range.

remote:          tools/thermal: add --target-temp parameter to 'tmon' tool
remote:
remote:          If we launch in daemon mode (--daemon), we don't have the ncurses UI,
remote:          but we might want to set the target temperature still. For example,
remote:          someone might stick the following in their boot script:
remote:
remote:            tmon --control intel_powerclamp --target-temp 90 --log --daemon
remote:
remote:          This would turn on CPU idle injection when we're around 90 degrees
remote:          celsius, and would log temperature and throttling info to
remote:          /var/tmp/tmon.log.

remote:
remote:          This patch modifies intel_powerclamp driver can be used in not only x86
remote:          but also ARM. Any ARM system can use intel_powerclamp driver for managing
remote:          thermal problem through injecting intentional idle cycle. The required
remote:          modification is only that it replaces x86's instruction, mwait, with arm
remote:          specific one, wfi and changes the way of calculation of idle rate of last
remote:          window. Other algorithm and codes can be shared without any amendment.

remote:  The current driver was missing a few key things to allow GPIO interrupts to be
remote:  properly used as wake-up sources as intended:
remote:
remote:  - the IRQCHIP_MASK_ON_SUSPEND should only apply to the non wake-up capable
remote:    controllers
remote:  - we need to know which GPIO interrupt line is requested to be a
remote:    wake-up source, and program its interrupt mask accordingly to make it able to
remote:    wake-up the system
remote:
remote:  In order to accomplish that, we introduce a per-GPIO bank bitmask of active
remote:  sources (wake_active) and program it into GIO_MASK when we are about to
remote:  suspend.

remote:  [Upstream commit 8275cdd0e7ac550dcce2b3ef6d2fb3b808c1ae59]
remote:
remote:  Commit e461fcb ("xfs: remote attribute lookups require the value
remote:  length") passes the remote attribute length in the xfs_da_args
remote:  structure on lookup so that CRC calculations and validity checking
remote:  can be performed correctly by related code. This, unfortunately has
remote:  the side effect of changing the args->valuelen parameter in cases
remote:  where it shouldn't.
remote:
remote:  That is, when we replace a remote attribute, the incoming
remote:  replacement stores the value and length in args->value and
remote:  args->valuelen, but then the lookup which finds the existing remote
remote:  attribute overwrites args->valuelen with the length of the remote
remote:  attribute being replaced. Hence when we go to create the new
remote:  attribute, we create it of the size of the existing remote
remote:  attribute, not the size it is supposed to be. When the new attribute
remote:  is much smaller than the old attribute, this results in a
remote:  transaction overrun and an ASSERT() failure on a debug kernel:
remote:
remote:  XFS: Assertion failed: tp->t_blk_res_used <= tp->t_blk_res, file: fs/xfs/xfs_trans.c, line: 331
remote:
remote:  Fix this by keeping the remote attribute value length separate to
remote:  the attribute value length in the xfs_da_args structure. The enables
remote:  us to pass the length of the remote attribute to be removed without
remote:  overwriting the new attribute's length.
remote:
remote:  Also, ensure that when we save remote block contexts for a later
remote:  rename we zero the original state variables so that we don't confuse
remote:  the state of the attribute to be removes with the state of the new
remote:  attribute that we just added. [Spotted by Brain Foster.]

remote:  [Upstream commit 23567fd052a9abb6d67fe8e7a9ccdd9800a540f2]
remote:
remote:  This fixes CVE-2016-0728.
remote:
remote:  If a thread is asked to join as a session keyring the keyring that's already
remote:  set as its session, we leak a keyring reference.
remote:
remote:  This can be tested with the following program:
remote:
remote:  	#include <stddef.h>
remote:  	#include <stdio.h>
remote:  	#include <sys/types.h>
remote:  	#include <keyutils.h>
remote:
remote:  	int main(int argc, const char *argv[])
remote:  	{
remote:  		int i = 0;
remote:  		key_serial_t serial;
remote:
remote:  		serial = keyctl(KEYCTL_JOIN_SESSION_KEYRING,
remote:  				"leaked-keyring");
remote:  		if (serial < 0) {
remote:  			perror("keyctl");
remote:  			return -1;
remote:  		}
remote:
remote:  		if (keyctl(KEYCTL_SETPERM, serial,
remote:  			   KEY_POS_ALL | KEY_USR_ALL) < 0) {
remote:  			perror("keyctl");
remote:  			return -1;
remote:  		}
remote:
remote:  		for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
remote:  			serial = keyctl(KEYCTL_JOIN_SESSION_KEYRING,
remote:  					"leaked-keyring");
remote:  			if (serial < 0) {
remote:  				perror("keyctl");
remote:  				return -1;
remote:  			}
remote:  		}
remote:
remote:  		return 0;
remote:  	}
remote:
remote:  If, after the program has run, there something like the following line in
remote:  /proc/keys:
remote:
remote:  3f3d898f I--Q---   100 perm 3f3f0000     0     0 keyring   leaked-keyring: empty
remote:
remote:  with a usage count of 100 * the number of times the program has been run,
remote:  then the kernel is malfunctioning.  If leaked-keyring has zero usages or
remote:  has been garbage collected, then the problem is fixed.

remote:  On systems using IPP (Invert Port Power), mounted USB 3.0
remote:  devices will get re-enumerated on S3 resume and the mounted
remote:  filesystem will no longer be accessible. This is happening
remote:  because a system using IPP will power up with USB power
remote:  enabled to the USB devices until the IPP can be set by software.
remote:  This is enough time for 3.0 devices to timeout on the 3.0
remote:  connect attempt (because the 3.0 PHY has not yet been enabled)
remote:  and fall back to a 2.0 device. This shouldn't be a problem
remote:  because the 3.0 devices in 2.0 mode would normally be power
remote:  cycled after the software sets IPP correctly, but the USB driver
remote:  turns on device power so quickly after we set IPP that the device
remote:  doesn't see the power cycle (on a 7445SV board it takes about
remote:  8ms for power to drop to zero). This change adds a 50ms delay
remote:  when IPP is being set. The delay is only added if IPP was not
remote:  already set to avoid delays if BOLT already set IPP.

remote:  The gpiolib irqchip helpers will use irq_unmask if irq_enable is not
remote:  defined.  However, when using the handle_simple_irq() generic handler
remote:  the irq_disable service will not use irq_mask to disable the interrupt.
remote:
remote:  When using the handle_simple_irq() generic handler it should be enough
remote:  to define irq_enable and irq_disable, but since we are using the flag
remote:  IRQCHIP_MASK_ON_SUSPEND we need to define the irq_mask as well.
remote:
remote:  This commit just defines irq_disabled the same as irq_mask so that
remote:  calls to disable_irq for gpio interrupts will mask the interrupt.

remote:  [Upstream commit a28726b4fb624f81d637a8afb9ea12fc16500f61]
remote:
remote:  pstore compression/decompression was added during 3.12.
remote:  The ramoops driver prepends a "====timestamp.timestamp-C|D\n"
remote:  header to the compressed record before handing it over to pstore
remote:  driver which doesn't know about the header. In pstore_decompress(),
remote:  the pstore driver reads the first "==" as a zlib header, so the
remote:  decompression always fails. For example, this causes the driver
remote:  to write /dev/pstore/dmesg-ramoops-0.enc.z instead of
remote:  /dev/pstore/dmesg-ramoops-0.
remote:
remote:  This patch makes the ramoops driver remove the header before
remote:  pstore decompression.

remote:  The thermal API in v3.14 of the kernel uses unsigned long values to

remote:  This commit restricts the temperature values reported by the get_temp()

remote:  The brcmstb_thermal driver was not properly handling computations of
remote:  negative temperatures.  This was partly attributable to inconsistency
remote:  in the v3.14 kernel thermal API which largely defines temperatures to
remote:  be unsigned.
remote:
remote:  Later versions of the kernel have cleaned up the thermal API to always
remote:  represent temperatures with type int.  This commit changes the internal
remote:  representations of temperatures within the driver to use type int and
remote:  corrects the bounds checking and computations accordingly.

remote:  The current default vmalloc size has been bumped up to
remote:  744MiB for platforms with >= 1 GiB (and if more than one
remote:  meminfo bank exists). As the memory banks > 760MiB (the
remote:  maximum lowmem size for a 3:1 kernel split) are split at
remote:  the lowmem/highmem boundary, the automatic bmem reservation
remote:  scheme breaks when 760MiB < memory size < 1GiB.
remote:
remote:  For example, if the bank size is 768MiB, it's split into
remote:  a 760MiB lowmem and 8MiB highmem bank. The bmem reservation
remote:  algorithm keeps all of the 760MiB for the system and only
remote:  ends up reserving 8MiB for bmem.
remote:
remote:  This patch sets the default vmalloc size for memory banks
remote:  > 760MiB to 744MiB. The change ensures the bmem automatic
remote:  reservation algorithm works correctly for 760MiB < memory
remote:  size < 1GiB.

remote:  Customers are requesting the ability to change the Host and Card
remote:  Driver Type (drive strength) because they are seeing interference
remote:  with WiFi and having Certification issues. This change allows new
remote:  Device Tree properties to change the default Driver Type for both
remote:  Host and Card. Not all cards support all Driver Types and if the
remote:  requested type is not supported the default will continue to be used.
remote:  The SD spec states that only UHS modes use selectable driver strength,
remote:  but our host controller allows it for HS mode as well. A customer
remote:  has requested support for the HS setting so an additional device
remote:  tree property was added for this.
remote:
remote:  The Device Tree properties that control the drive strength are:
remote:  "host-driver-strength", "host-hs-driver-strength" and
remote:  "card-driver-strength". These properties can have the value
remote:  "A", "B", "C", or "D". Where A is x1.5, B is x1.0 (default),
remote:  C is x0.75 and D is x0.5
remote:
remote:  NOTES
remote:   o Reducing Drive Strength may result in read/write errors
remote:     depending on the board design.
remote:   o The Host side settings are not supported on the 74371, which
remote:     uses the older version of the SDIO core.

remote:  Configuring the ethtool tx-frames property, which translates into N

remote:  because it requires no locking neither at the softare nor hardware

remote:  interrupt coalescing when the value is > 1.
remote:
remote:  Since the HW is configured to generate an interrupt when the ring
remote:  becomes emtpy, we have to deny any timeout/timer settings coming from
remote:  user-space to indicate we can only generate an interrupt very <N>
remote:  packets.

remote:  We had the timeout set as msecs_to_jiffies(10), and were seeing bad timeout
remote:  values.  Now, with CONFIG_HZ=100, a jiffy is ~10 ms, so msecs_to_jiffies(10)
remote:  ends up returning 1 jiffy.  Unfortunately, if I understand correctly, waiting
remote:  for a single jiffy isn't that effective, because it means you could be waiting
remote:  for basically no time at all, depending on when your operation is scheduled to
remote:  occur.  This matches up with what we were seeing, which is that when several
remote:  SPI writes were scheduled in sequence, it would consistently fail after several
remote:  ms, which suggests the following:
remote:
remote:  time
remote:   |
remote:   v                                       tick occurs
remote:   |
remote:   v        other things happen
remote:   |
remote:   v        SPI write starts
remote:   |
remote:   v        SPI write finishes
remote:   |
remote:   v        next SPI write starts
remote:   |                                       tick occurs
remote:   v        SPI write is considered to have timed out
remote:
remote:  Increase the timeout to 11 (which will be rounded up to 2 jiffies) seems to
remote:  make this problem go away entirely, which further supports this idea.  But
remote:  looking at a sampling of SPI bus drivers in drivers/spi/ suggests that it's
remote:  probably just best to set a larger timeout value, so let's set it to HZ (will
remote:  result in 1s timeout).

remote:  Some comments that are NOT FOR UPSTREAM, explaining what was changed from
remote:  original spi-brcmstb driver:
remote:
remote:  - removes BSPI support (this should be made into a proper spi-nor framework
remote:    driver), which means we don't poke EBI CS anymore
remote:  - removes EBI CS switching, which is only needed for memory mapping
remote:  - add write lock field for use with BSPI
remote:  - use the BCM7120 L2 driver instead of twiddling L2 directly from here
remote:  - get rid of useless debug prints and unused fields
remote:  - use newer transfer_one spi core API
remote:  - use spi_transfer_is_last() instead of directly checking transfer_list
remote:  - remove unnecessary state and locking
remote:  - add timeout to wait_for_completion
remote:  - request mspi_done IRQ
remote:
remote:  Changes added by Gregory and Florian:
remote:
remote:  Until the spi-nor framework is used to allow using BSPI with this
remote:  driver, the spi-brcmstb driver, if enabled, should be used for HIF SPI
remote:  (MSPI+BSPI) instead.  This will then only be used when the compatible
remote:  string is "brcm,spi-brcmstb-mspi".

remote:  All ARMv5 and older CPUs invalidate their caches in the early assembly
remote:  setup function, prior to enabling the MMU.  This is because the L1
remote:  cache should not contain any data relevant to the execution of the
remote:  kernel at this point; all data should have been flushed out to memory.
remote:
remote:  This requirement should also be true for ARMv6 and ARMv7 CPUs - indeed,
remote:  these typically do not search their caches when caching is disabled (as
remote:  it needs to be when the MMU is disabled) so this change should be safe.
remote:
remote:  ARMv7 allows there to be CPUs which search their caches while caching is
remote:  disabled, and it's permitted that the cache is uninitialised at boot;
remote:  for these, the architecture reference manual requires that an
remote:  implementation specific code sequence is used immediately after reset
remote:  to ensure that the cache is placed into a sane state.  Such
remote:  functionality is definitely outside the remit of the Linux kernel, and
remote:  must be done by the SoC's firmware before _any_ CPU gets to the Linux
remote:  kernel.
remote:
remote:  Changing the data cache clean+invalidate to a mere invalidate allows us
remote:  to get rid of a lot of platform specific hacks around this issue for
remote:  their secondary CPU bringup paths - some of which were buggy.

remote:  which should only be necessary when first calling GUP or when crossing a vma
remote:  bound, so by changing to jump to next_page and instead also calling
remote:  brcmstb_get_page() in the inner loop, that should help to optimize GUP for BMEM
remote:  and CMA.

remote:  [Upstream commit 8d88c6ebb34c3e54debe81e9b0d81b60411f8179]
remote:
remote:  Currently, MoCA fixed PHYs are always in link-up state, regardless of
remote:  whether the link is actually up or not.
remote:
remote:  Add code to properly detect MoCA link state changes and to reflect the
remote:  new state in MoCA fixed PHY. Only GENET V3 and V4 MACs are capable of
remote:  detecting MoCA link state changes.
remote:
remote:  The code works as follows:
remote:  1. GENET MAC detects MoCA link state change and issues UMAC_IRQ_LINK_UP
remote:     or UMAC_IRQ_LINK_DOWN interrupt.
remote:  2. Link up/down interrupt is processed in bcmgenet_irq_task(), which
remote:     calls phy_mac_interrupt().
remote:  3. phy_mac_interrupt() updates the fixed PHY phydev->link and kicks
remote:     the PHY state machine.
remote:  4. PHY state machine proceeds to read the fixed PHY link status
remote:     register.
remote:  5. When the fixed PHY link status register is being read, the new
remote:     function bcmgenet_fixed_phy_link_update() gets called. It copies
remote:     the fixed PHY phydev->link value to the fixed PHY status->link.
remote:  6. PHY state machine receives the new link state of the fixed PHY.
remote:  7. MoCA fixed PHY link state now correctly reflects the real MoCA
remote:     hardware link state.

remote:  The AHCI driver code stops and starts port DMA engines at will
remote:  without considering the power state of the particular port. The
remote:  AHCI specification isn't very clear on how to handle this scenario,
remote:  leaving implementation open to interpretation.
remote:
remote:  Broadcom's STB SATA host controller is unable to handle port DMA
remote:  controller restarts when the port in question is in low power mode.
remote:  When a port enters partial or slumber mode, it's PHY is powered down.
remote:  When a controller restart is requested, the controller's internal
remote:  state machine expects the PHY to be brought back up by software which
remote:  never happens in this case, resulting in failures.
remote:
remote:  To avoid this situation, logic is added to manually wake up the port
remote:  just before it's DMA engine is stopped, if the port happens to be in
remote:  a low power state. HBA initiated power management ensures that the port
remote:  eventually returns to it's configured low power state, when the link is
remote:  idle (as per the conditions listed in the spec). A new host flag is also
remote:  added to ensure this logic is only exercised for hosts with the above
remote:  limitation.

remote:  Our irq-bcm7120-l2 interrupt controller driver utilizes the same handler
remote:  function for the different parent interrupts it services: UPG_MAIN, UPG_BSC for
remote:  instance.
remote:
remote:  The problem is that function reads the IRQSTAT register which can combine
remote:  interrupt causes for different parent interrupts, such that we can end-up in the
remote:  following situation:
remote:
remote:  - CPU takes an interrupt
remote:  - bcm7120_l2_intc_irq_handle() reads IRQSTAT
remote:  - generic_handle_irq() is invoked
remote:  - there are still pending interrupts flagged in IRQSTAT from a different parent
remote:  - handle_bad_irq() is invoked
remote:
remote:  In order to fix this, make sure that we always mask IRQSTAT with the
remote:  appropriate bits that correspond go the parent interrupt source this is coming
remote:  from. To simplify things, associate an unique structure per parent interrupt
remote:  handler to avoid multiplying the number of lookups.
remote:
remote:  While at it, remove the unused 'gc' argument from bcm7120_l2_intc_irq_handle().

remote:  [Upstream commit f668f074ff58dea540d83bbed1b2c1171b0dd764]
remote:
remote:  This check may be prone to race conditions, e.g.
remote:
remote:  1) Some external event (e.g. GPIO level) causes an IRQ to become pending
remote:  2) Peripheral asserts the L2 IRQ
remote:  3) CPU takes an interrupt
remote:  4) The event from #1 goes away
remote:  5) bcm7120_l2_intc_irq_handle() reads back a 0 status
remote:
remote:  Unlike the hardware supported by brcmstb-l2, the bcm7120-l2 controller
remote:  does not latch the IRQ status.  Bits can change if the inputs to the
remote:  controller change.  Also, do_bad_IRQ() is an ARM-specific macro.
remote:
remote:  So let's just nuke it.

remote:  vmap(), by default, checks to see that the number of pages is not larger than
remote:  the total number of pages managed by Linux.  Usually, this is a nice sanity
remote:  check, and we want to keep that for any of the kernel's vmap() invocations.
remote:  However, this is a problem for our use case because we actually want to vmap()
remote:  pages that are _not_ managed by Linux.  This essentially copies vmap() but
remote:  removes the check against totalram_pages.

remote:  Currently, USB 3.0 SSC is enabled via port 0 MDIO registers, which
remote:  should have been adequate. However, due to a bug in the USB 3.0 PHY,
remote:  it must be enabled via both ports.

remote:  When updating the default reservation code to handle reserved-memory[1]
remote:  DT entries in addition to memreserve, I made an off-by-one error when

remote:  incorrect size for memreserve at the end of a region.  Fix that,

remote:  When using eMMC as the boot device, some Micron eMMC devices will
remote:  cause reboot to hang. This is a result of the eMMC device not going
remote:  into boot mode after the hardware sends CMD0 to reset the eMMC
remote:  device. This only happens if the kernel driver sends CMD5 (SLEEP_WAKE),
remote:  to put the device into sleep state, before restarting the system.
remote:  The fix is to add a quirk that avoids sending the SLEEP command
remote:  and to use MMC_FIXUP to set the quirk for these Micron devices.

remote:
remote:  These changes were tested against an upstream kernel which contains some
remote:  improvements on how SKB allocation in NAPI context operate, and these changes
remote:  are not in 3.14 yet and way too invasive to backport.
remote:
remote:  Revert back to the previous behavior which consists in invalidating data cache

remote:
remote:  Tested on 73649a0 (512M RAM) that default boot-time CMA reserve works

remote:  BCM53125 switches. This motivated the need to utilize the internal SF2
remote:  MDIO controller via indirect register reads/writes to control external
remote:  Broadcom switches due to this address conflict (both responded at
remote:  address 30d).
remote:
remote:  For 7445E0, the internal pseudo-PHY of the SF2 switch got disconnected,
remote:  and as a consequence this prevents the internal SF2 MDIO bus controller
remote:  from reading data (reads back everything as 0) since the MDI line is
remote:  tied low.
remote:
remote:  Fix this by making the indirect register reads and writes conditional to
remote:  7445D0, on 7445E0 we can utilize the SWITCH_MDIO controller (backed by
remote:  mdio-unimac and not the DSA created slave MII bus).

remote:  [Upstream commit 1c8732bb0355b929b09173464cdca7df4d516f89]
remote:
remote:  Some off-chip GPIO expanders need to be communicated by I2C or
remote:  SPI traffic, but may still support IRQs. By the sleeping nature
remote:  of such buses, such IRQ handlers need to be threaded. Support
remote:  such handlers in the gpiochip irqchip helpers by flagging IRQs
remote:  as threaded if the .can_sleep property of the gpiochip is
remote:  true.
remote:
remote:  Helpfully deny registration of chained IRQ handlers if the
remote:  .can_sleep property is set, as such chips will invariably need
remote:  a nested handler rather than a chained handler.

remote:  [Upstream commit 1425052097b53de841e064dc190a9009480c208c]

remote:  [Upstream commit 77c2d7929d7d7f0e391b17f85d2d954912ed0590]
remote:
remote:  Sometimes it is useful to allow GPIO chips themselves to request GPIOs they
remote:  own through gpiolib API. One use case is ACPI ASL code that should be able
remote:  to toggle GPIOs through GPIO operation regions.
remote:
remote:  We can't use gpio_request() because it will pin the module to the kernel
remote:  forever (it calls try_module_get()). To solve this we move module refcount
remote:  manipulation to gpiod_request() and let __gpiod_request() handle the actual
remote:  request. This changes the sequence a bit as now try_module_get() is called
remote:  outside of gpio_lock (I think this is safe, try_module_get() handles
remote:  serialization it needs already).
remote:
remote:  Then we provide gpiolib internal functions gpiochip_request/free_own_desc()
remote:  that do the same as gpio_request() but don't manipulate module refrence
remote:  count. This allows the GPIO chip driver to request and free descriptors it
remote:  owns without being pinned to the kernel forever.

remote:  [Upstream commit bb1e88ccb771492ac908ac295ec135efa1d53093]
remote:
remote:  Some drivers dealing with a gpio_chip might need to act on its
remote:  descriptors directly; one example is pinctrl drivers that need to lock a
remote:  GPIO for being used as IRQ using gpiod_lock_as_irq().
remote:
remote:  This patch exports a gpiochip_get_desc() function that returns the
remote:  GPIO descriptor at the requested index. It also sweeps the
remote:  gpio_to_chip() function out of the consumer interface since any holder
remote:  of a gpio_chip reference can manipulate its GPIOs way beyond what a
remote:  consumer should be allowed to do.
remote:
remote:  As a result, gpio_chip is not visible anymore to simple GPIO consumers.

remote:  Adds a way for the Broadcom middleware (nexus) to be able to get the
remote:  information it needs about how memory is placed on the system.  This is done by
remote:  the ability to populate a struct brcmstb_memory with info on
remote:  - PA ranges for each memory controller
remote:  - static "bmem" ranges
remote:  - dynamic (CMA in this case) reserved ranges
remote:  - reserved areas unavailable to middleware
remote:
remote:  We use libfdt to read the device tree for info on what memory should actually
remote:  be visible.
remote:
remote:  Moves phys_addr_to_memc from cma_driver to memory API and renames as
remote:  brcmstb_memory_phys_addr_to_memc, since it is now shared by cma_driver and this
remote:  code.
remote:
remote:  This also adds to the platform reserve code in order to grab the memblock
remote:  reserve info during early boot, as the memblock info isn't discarded later.

remote:  Changes include:
remote:
remote:  - Place in drivers/soc/brcmstb
remote:  - Use new Kconfig entry to enable: CONFIG_BRCMSTB_BMEM
remote:  - No default allocation (must specify everything manually).
remote:  - Does not assume that address 0 means "put at end of memc0".  It'll put the
remote:    reserved regions wherever you want.
remote:  - No safeties: you can reserve all of lowmem if you want to watch the kernel
remote:    crash and burn.
remote:  - No special handling for memc1: not needed since we're not overriding the
remote:    default free_bootmem like on mips, but rather providing a saner means via
remote:    bmem_reserve which uses memblock and will be called from arch code.
remote:  - MAX_BMEM_REGIONS bumped from 4 to 8.
remote:  - Uses phys_addr_t instead of unsigned long so we can use >32-bit addresses
remote:    where appropriate.
remote:  - Don't BUG on pud_none in bmem_get_page because we've seen this unnecessarily
remote:    crashes the kernel on ARM when called from GUP (see SWLINUX-3350)

remote:  Currently, bcm_sysport_desc_rx() calls bcm_sysport_rx_refill() at the end of Rx
remote:  packet processing loop, after the current Rx packet has already been passed to
remote:  napi_gro_receive(). However, bcm_sysport_rx_refill() might fail to allocate a new
remote:  Rx skb, thus leaving a hole on the Rx queue where no valid Rx buffer exists.
remote:
remote:  To eliminate this situation:
remote:
remote:  1. Rewrite bcm_sysport_rx_refill() to retain the current Rx skb on the
remote:  Rx queue if a new replacement Rx skb can't be allocated and DMA-mapped.
remote:  In this case, the data on the current Rx skb is effectively dropped.
remote:
remote:  2. Modify bcm_sysport_desc_rx() to call bcm_sysport_rx_refill() at the
remote:  top of Rx packet processing loop, so that the new replacement Rx skb is
remote:  already in place before the current Rx skb is processed.
remote:
remote:  This is loosely inspired from d6707bec5986 ("net: bcmgenet: rewrite
remote:  bcmgenet_rx_refill()")

remote:  Several drivers (e.g. gpio-keys) allow for GPIOs to be configured as wakeup
remote:  sources, and this GPIO controller supports that through a separate interrupt
remote:  path.
remote:
remote:  The de-facto standard DT property "wakeup-source" is checked, since that
remote:  indicates whether the GPIO controller hardware can wake.  Uses the
remote:  IRQCHIP_MASK_ON_SUSPEND irq_chip flag because UPG GIO doesn't have any of its
remote:  own wakeup source configuration.

remote:  [Upstream commit 23600969ff137cf4c3bc9098f77e381de334e3f7]
remote:
remote:  Nothing prevents GPIO drivers from returning values outside the
remote:  boolean range, and as it turns out a few drivers are actually doing so.
remote:  These values were passed as-is to unsuspecting consumers and created
remote:  confusion.
remote:
remote:  This patch makes the internal _gpiod_get_raw_value() function return a
remote:  bool, effectively clamping the GPIO value to the boolean range no
remote:  matter what the driver does.
remote:
remote:  While we are at it, we also change the value parameter of
remote:  _gpiod_set_raw_value() to bool type before drivers start doing funny
remote:  things with it as well.
remote:
remote:  Another way to fix this would be to change the prototypes of the driver
remote:  interface to use bool directly, but this would require a huge
remote:  cross-systems patch so this simpler solution is preferred.
remote:
remote:  Changes since v1:
remote:  - Change local variable type to bool as well, use boolean values in
remote:    code
remote:  - Also change prototype of open drain/open source setting functions
remote:    since they are only called from _gpiod_set_raw_value()
remote:
remote:  This probably calls for a larger booleanization of gpiolib, but let's
remote:  keep that for a latter change - right now we need to address the issue
remote:  of non-boolean values returned by drivers.

remote:  [Upstream commit 3be2a49e5c08d268f8af0dd4fe89a24ea8cdc339]
remote:
remote:  Some Ethernet MACs have a "fixed link", and are not connected to a
remote:  normal MDIO-managed PHY device. For those situations, a Device Tree
remote:  binding allows to describe a "fixed link" using a special PHY node.
remote:
remote:  This patch adds:
remote:
remote:   * A documentation for the fixed PHY Device Tree binding.
remote:
remote:   * An of_phy_is_fixed_link() function that an Ethernet driver can call
remote:     on its PHY phandle to find out whether it's a fixed link PHY or
remote:     not. It should typically be used to know if
remote:     of_phy_register_fixed_link() should be called.
remote:
remote:   * An of_phy_register_fixed_link() function that instantiates the
remote:     fixed PHY into the PHY subsystem, so that when the driver calls
remote:     of_phy_connect(), the PHY device associated to the OF node will be
remote:     found.
remote:
remote:  These two additional functions also support the old fixed-link Device
remote:  Tree binding used on PowerPC platforms, so that ultimately, the
remote:  network device drivers for those platforms could be converted to use
remote:  of_phy_is_fixed_link() and of_phy_register_fixed_link() instead of
remote:  of_phy_connect_fixed_link(), while keeping compatibility with their
remote:  respective Device Tree bindings.

remote:  [Upstream commit a75951217472c522c324adb0a4de3ba69d656ef5]
remote:
remote:  The existing fixed_phy_add() function has several drawbacks that
remote:  prevents it from being used as is for OF-based declaration of fixed
remote:  PHYs:
remote:
remote:   * The address of the PHY on the fake bus needs to be passed, while a
remote:     dynamic allocation is desired.
remote:
remote:   * Since the phy_device instantiation is post-poned until the next
remote:     mdiobus scan, there is no way to associate the fixed PHY with its
remote:     OF node, which later prevents of_phy_connect() from finding this
remote:     fixed PHY from a given OF node.
remote:
remote:  To solve this, this commit introduces fixed_phy_register(), which will
remote:  allocate an available PHY address, add the PHY using fixed_phy_add()
remote:  and instantiate the phy_device structure associated with the provided
remote:  OF node.

remote:  [Upstream commit 9b744942290c168287013f0a19ff7392f65c8107]
remote:
remote:  Until now, the fixed_phy_add() function was taking as argument
remote:  'phy_id', which was used both as the PHY address on the fake fixed
remote:  MDIO bus, and as the PHY id, as available in the MII_PHYSID1 and
remote:  MII_PHYSID2 registers. However, those two informations are completely
remote:  unrelated.
remote:
remote:  This patch decouples them. The PHY id of fixed PHYs is hardcoded to be
remote:  0x0. Ideally, a really reserved value would be nicer, but there
remote:  doesn't seem to be an easy of making sure a dummy value can be
remote:  assigned to the Linux kernel for such usage.
remote:
remote:  The PHY address remains passed by the caller of phy_fixed_add().

remote:  Now that the thermal core supplies trip notifications when
remote:  *crossing* a trip point, and only for that single trip point, it is
remote:  useful to provide this information in the uevent metadata. That way, a
remote:  user-space governor can figure out this information directly, without
remote:  any guessing. This also eliminates a potential race, where the
remote:  temperature may have changed between the time a hardware trip was fired
remote:  and the time it is received by the governor.
remote:
remote:  This patch should be submitted upstream. It's possible this will not
remote:  suit the general needs of other thermal users, and so we might consider
remote:  integrating this directly into brcmstb_thermal instead.

remote:  For some reason, the existing infrastructure will notify *all* trip

remote:  Instead, let's only call handle_thermal_trip() when we've crossed a

remote:  [Backported preliminary patch. See thread:
remote:  http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.power-management.general/58483/]
remote:
remote:  This adds support for hardware-tracked trip points to the device tree
remote:  thermal sensor framework.
remote:
remote:  The framework supports an arbitrary number of trip points. Whenever
remote:  the current temperature is updated, the trip points immediately
remote:  below and above the current temperature are found. A .set_trips
remote:  callback is then called with the temperatures. If there is no trip
remote:  point above or below the current temperature, the passed trip
remote:  temperature will be ULONG_MAX or 0 respectively. In this callback,
remote:  the driver should program the hardware such that it is notified
remote:  when either of these trip points are triggered. When a trip point
remote:  is triggered, the driver should call `thermal_zone_device_update'
remote:  for the respective thermal zone. This will cause the trip points
remote:  to be updated again.
remote:
remote:  If .set_trips is not implemented, the framework behaves as before.
remote:
remote:  This patch is based on an earlier version from Mikko Perttunen

remote:  [Backported preliminary patch. See thread:
remote:  http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.power-management.general/58483/]
remote:
remote:  The thermal core uses the existence of the .get_temp, .get_trend and

remote:  for of-thermal which has to modify the struct thermal_zone_device_ops

remote:  			  enum thermal_trend *);
remote:

remote:
remote:  Streamline both prototypes and add the trip argument to the OF callback
remote:  aswell and use enum thermal_trend * instead of an integer pointer.

remote:  [Backported preliminary patch. See thread:
remote:  http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.power-management.general/58483/]
remote:
remote:  commit e6e238c38 (thermal: sysfs: Add a new sysfs node emul_temp for
remote:  thermal emulation)  promised not to emulate critical temperatures,
remote:  but the check for critical temperatures is broken in multiple ways:
remote:
remote:  - The code should only accept an emulated temperature when the emulated
remote:    temperature is lower than the critical temperature. Instead the code
remote:    accepts an emulated temperature whenever the real temperature is lower
remote:    than the critical temperature. This makes no sense and trying to
remote:    emulate a temperature higher than the critical temperature halts the
remote:    system.
remote:  - When trying to emulate a higher-than-critical temperature we should either
remote:    limit the emulated temperature to the maximum non critical temperature
remote:    or refuse to emulate this temperature. Instead the code just silently
remote:    ignores the emulated temperature and continues with the real temperature.
remote:
remote:  This patch moves the test for illegal emulated temperature to the sysfs
remote:  write function so that we can properly refuse illegal temperatures here.
remote:  Trying to write illegal temperatures results in an error message. While
remote:  at it use IS_ENABLED() instead of #ifdefs.

remote:  Different drivers request API extensions in of-thermal. For this reason,

remote:
remote:  The current API implementation expects the registering sensor driver
remote:  to provide a get_temp and get_trend callbacks as function parameters.
remote:  As the amount of callbacks is growing, this patch changes the existing
remote:  implementation to use a .ops field to hold all the of thermal callbacks
remote:  to sensor drivers.
remote:
remote:  This patch also changes the existing of-thermal users to fit the new
remote:  API design. No functional change is introduced in this patch.

remote:  Add support to check status of the thermal zone before registering the
remote:  zone. This will help on disabling some non-existing thermal zone from
remote:  the top level DTS file out of common dtsi thermalzone file.
remote:
remote:  For example,
remote:  we have 3 platforms almost same but thermal zones on this platform are
remote:  little bit different. Platform 1 and 2 have three thermal zones and
remote:  platform 3 has two thermal zones. To avoid duplication of the thermal
remote:  zones entries on each DTS file of platforms,we created one common
remote:  dtsi file for thermal zone and included this dtsi file from these
remote:  3 platform's top level dts file.
remote:
remote:  On common thermal zone com dtsi file, all thermal zone are enabled and
remote:  need to disable one of thermal zone on platform 3 dts file. For this, we
remote:  just added entry status = "disabled" for that thermal zone on platform 3
remote:  dts file and along with this change to make it work.
remote:
remote:  This way, we reuse the common file and control the enable/disable of the
remote:  thermal zone from top level dts file.

remote:  [Backported version of patch from:
remote:  http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.power-management.general/59004
remote:  Some discussion at:
remote:  lkml.kernel.org/g/20150413201433.GQ32500@ld-irv-0074]
remote:
remote:  On 32-bit architectures, 'unsigned long' (the type used to hold clock
remote:  rates, in Hz) is often only 32 bits wide. DIV_ROUND_UP() (as used in,
remote:  e.g., commit b11d282dbea2 "clk: divider: fix rate calculation for
remote:  fractional rates") can yield an integer overflow on clock rates that are
remote:  not (by themselves) too large to fit in 32 bits, because it performs
remote:  addition before the division. See for example:
remote:
remote:    DIV_ROUND_UP(3000000000, 1500000000) = (3.0G + 1.5G - 1) / 1.5G
remote:                                         = OVERFLOW / 1.5G
remote:
remote:  This patch fixes such cases by always promoting the dividend to 64-bits
remote:  (unsigned long long) before doing the division. While this patch does
remote:  not resolve the issue with large clock rates across the common clock
remote:  framework nor address the problems with doing full 64-bit arithmetic on
remote:  a 32-bit architecture, it does fix some issues seen when using clock
remote:  dividers on a 3GHz reference clock to produce a 1.5GHz CPU clock for an
remote:  ARMv7 Brahma B15 SoC.

remote:  _register_divider() expects a mask width parameter, not the mask itself.
remote:
remote:  Also add extra sanity checking on the device tree, since we really
remote:  expect a contiguous mask, packed to the low bit position.
remote:
remote:  Note that the code in question has not been merged upstream; the
remote:  original code was just grabbed off the mailing list.
remote:
remote:  Perhaps for an upstream submission, this property should be reworked as
remote:  a 'mask-width' parameter instead? It's not clear to me what we would do
remote:  with a non-contiguous mask, as this binding (and driver) was not really
remote:  designed for it. And I don't think such hardware exists, at least not in
remote:  a sane world.

remote:  [Upstream commit 6c3ff8b11a16ec69199ab85b74a5fae6d9c59db7]
remote:
remote:  The goal of multi-platform kernels is to remove the need for mach
remote:  directories and machine descriptors. To further that goal,
remote:  introduce CPU_METHOD_OF_DECLARE() to allow cpu hotplug/smp
remote:  support to be separated from the machine descriptors.
remote:  Implementers should specify an enable-method property in their
remote:  cpus node and then implement a matching set of smp_ops in their
remote:  hotplug/smp code, wiring it up with the CPU_METHOD_OF_DECLARE()
remote:  macro. When the kernel is compiled we'll collect all the
remote:  enable-method smp_ops into one section for use at boot.
remote:
remote:  At boot time we'll look for an enable-method in each cpu node and
remote:  try to match that against all known CPU enable methods in the
remote:  kernel. If there are no enable-methods in the cpu nodes we
remote:  fallback to the cpus node and try to use any enable-method found
remote:  there. If that doesn't work we fall back to the old way of using
remote:  the machine descriptor.

remote:  [Upstream submission: https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/4/8/754 ]
remote:
remote:  get_symbol_str() was assuming that symbols would only have a single
remote:  property for the purpose of printing define and depends information.
remote:  This is not true, and one current example is FRAME_POINTER which is
remote:  both in lib/Kconfig.debug and arch/arm/Kconfig.debug.
remote:
remote:  In order to print out the correct Defined and Depends info, iterate
remote:  over all properties associated with the given symbol, similarly to was
remote:  done for selects.  And for depends, rather than iterating over the
remote:  property, just use the direct dependency expression.

remote:  Since vmalloc is being used in arch/arm/mm/mmu.c to shrink the size of bank 0

remote:  Now, altering the size of CMA regions on memc0 will be done entirely using the

remote:  If >= 1 GiB RAM is present (or more than one meminfo bank exists), this
remote:  increases the vmalloc area to 744 MiB and thus reduces the default amount of
remote:  lowmem to 256 MiB, which is basically all we were getting anyway with
remote:  cma_driver putting all other memory in CMA regions.  This should eliminate what
remote:  has been referred to as the "CMA barrier" (the split in memory regions on the
remote:  first memory controller because of the lowmem/highmem boundary) without
remote:  negatively impacting the actual amount of memory on the system (kernel
remote:  allocations mostly couldn't use lowmem in CMA regions anyway).
remote:
remote:  It'd be nice if we could just have more lowmem so as not to help alleviate
remote:  lowmem exhaustion, but that's a problem for another day.
remote:
remote:  For systems with < 1GB RAM, there was no CMA barrier, so we keep the default
remote:  vmalloc size the same.
remote:
remote:  This will probably need updating if there are ever any boards with 768 MiB RAM.
remote:  Also, the function relies on meminfo so will need to be updated for 3.16+, which
remote:  no longer uses meminfo.

remote:  this one must also be annotated with __init.

remote:  absolutely not expected and should not be done.
remote:
remote:  While at it, propagate the return code from bcmgenet_power_down() to the
remote:  callers that care about it such as bcmgenet_close() and bcmgenet_suspend().

remote:  [Upstream commit 803dd9c77ac3a08958535f2a1ad5890104e2c235]
remote:
remote:  As part of a call to ndo_close() a netdevice driver may call
remote:  phy_disconnect() -> phy_detach() -> phy_suspend(), such that the PHY is
remote:  suspsended at this point and a netdevice driver may clock gate the
remote:  backing peripheral providing MDIO bus accessses as well.
remote:
remote:  Update mdio_bus_phy_may_suspend() to return whether a PHY is allowed to
remote:  be suspended and conversely resumed if and only if it was not previously
remote:  suspended before while it is currently in detached (netdev pointer is
remote:  NULL) state.
remote:
remote:  This fixes bus errors seen during S2/S3 suspend/resume cycles for
remote:  netdevice drivers such as GENET which clock gates the entire Ethernet
remote:  MAC, including the MDIO bus block.

remote:  [Upstream commit 8a477a6fb6a33651adda772360b85fd813569743]
remote:
remote:  In order to avoid double calls to phydev->drv->suspend and resume, keep
remote:  track of whether the PHY has already been suspended as a consequence of
remote:  a successful call to phy_suspend(). We will use this in our MDIO bus
remote:  suspend/resume hooks to avoid a double suspend call.

remote:  [Upstream commit 9272efa2036f3f06625effc3a709416044578a92]
remote:
remote:  phy_suspend and phy_resume are an abstraction on top of the PHY device
remote:  driver suspend and resume callbacks, utilize those since they are the
remote:  proper interface to suspending and resuming a PHY device.

remote:  [Queued upstream]
remote:
remote:  When CONFIG_PM_DEBUG=y, we provide a sysfs file (/sys/power/pm_test) for
remote:  selecting one of a few suspend test modes, where rather than entering a
remote:  full suspend state, the kernel will perform some subset of suspend
remote:  steps, wait 5 seconds, and then resume back to normal operation.
remote:
remote:  This mode is useful for (among other things) observing the state of the
remote:  system just before entering a sleep mode, for debugging or analysis
remote:  purposes. However, a constant 5 second wait is not sufficient for some
remote:  sorts of analysis; for example, on an SoC, one might want to use
remote:  external tools to probe the power states of various on-chip controllers
remote:  or clocks.
remote:
remote:  This patch turns this 5 second delay into a configurable module
remote:  parameter, so users can determine how long to wait in this
remote:  pseudo-suspend state before resuming the system.
remote:
remote:  Example (wait 30 seconds);
remote:
remote:    # echo 30 > /sys/module/suspend/parameters/pm_test_delay
remote:    # echo core > /sys/power/pm_test
remote:    # time echo mem  > /sys/power/state
remote:    ...

remote:  This patch adds support for the Broadcom Brahma-B15 CPU readahead cache
remote:  controller. This cache controller sits between the L2 and the memory bus
remote:  and its purpose is to provide a friendler burst size towards the DDR
remote:  interface than the native cache line size.
remote:
remote:  The readahead cache is mostly transparent, except for
remote:  flush_kern_cache_all, flush_kern_cache_louis and flush_icache_all, which
remote:  is precisely what we are overriding here.
remote:
remote:  The readahead cache only intercepts reads, not writes, as such, some
remote:  data can remain stale in any of its buffers, such that we need to flush
remote:  it, which is an operation that needs to happen in a particular order:
remote:
remote:  - disable the readahead cache
remote:  - flush it
remote:  - call the appropriate cache-v7.S function
remote:  - re-enable
remote:
remote:  This patch tries to minimize the impact to the cache-v7.S file by only
remote:  providing a stub in case CONFIG_CACHE_B15_RAC is enabled (default for
remote:  ARCH_BRCMSTB since it is the current user).

remote:  Changes to the PM code have uncovered that if the host is too fast at
remote:  submitting BSP commands (e.g., clock stop and gen_random_key), the BSP
remote:  might not ever respond properly, causing a timeout.
remote:
remote:  According to the BSP firmware team, a few milliseconds (~2-3) wait after
remote:  the clock stop command should be sufficient to fend of such races within
remote:  the BSP. Let's add the hack.

remote:
remote:  Getting 1-2% savings in kernel size seems absolutely worth keeping the

remote:
remote:  This basically loses any of the BUG() reporting, but leaves the

remote:  Implement the bridge join, leave and set_stp callbacks by making that we
remote:  do the following:
remote:
remote:  - when a port joins the bridge, all existing ports in the bridge get
remote:    their VLAN control register updated with that joining port
remote:  - the joining port is including all existing bridge ports in its own
remote:    VLAN control register
remote:
remote:  The leave operation is fairly similar, special care must be taken to
remote:  make sure that port leaving the bridging is not removing itself from its
remote:  own VLAN control register.
remote:
remote:  Since the various BR_* states apply directly to our HW semantics, we just
remote:  need to translate these constants into their corresponding HW settings,
remote:  and voila!
remote:
remote:  We make sure to trigger a fast-ageing process for ports that are
remote:  joining/leaving the bridge and transition from incompatible states, this
remote:  is equivalent to triggering an ARL flush for that port.

remote:
remote:  DSA will resolve which switch ports are currently bridge port members as
remote:  some Switch hardware/drivers need to know about that to limit the
remote:  register programming to just the relevant registers (especially for slow
remote:  MDIO buses).
remote:
remote:  We also take care of setting the correct STP state when slave network
remote:  devices are brought up/down while being bridge members.
remote:
remote:  Finally, when a port is leaving the bridge, we make sure we set in
remote:  BR_STATE_FORWARDING state, otherwise the bridge layer would leave it
remote:  disabled as a result of having left the bridge.

remote:  [Upstream commit e48322abb061d75096fe52d71886b237e7ae7bfb]
remote:
remote:  When the system boots up, in the dmesg logs we can see the memory
remote:  statistics along with total reserved as below.  Memory: 458840k/458840k
remote:  available, 65448k reserved, 0K highmem
remote:
remote:  When CMA is enabled, still the total reserved memory remains the same.
remote:  However, the CMA memory is not considered as reserved.  But, when we see
remote:  /proc/meminfo, the CMA memory is part of free memory.  This creates
remote:  confusion.  This patch corrects the problem by properly subtracting the
remote:  CMA reserved memory from the total reserved memory in dmesg logs.
remote:
remote:  Below is the dmesg snapshot from an arm based device with 512MB RAM and
remote:  12MB single CMA region.
remote:
remote:  Before this change:
remote:    Memory: 458840k/458840k available, 65448k reserved, 0K highmem
remote:
remote:  After this change:
remote:    Memory: 458840k/458840k available, 53160k reserved, 12288k cma-reserved, 0K highmem

remote:  [Upstream commit b5be83e308f70e16c63c4e520ea7bb03ef57c46f]
remote:
remote:  The alignment in cma_alloc() was done w.r.t. the bitmap.  This is a
remote:  problem when, for example:
remote:
remote:  - a device requires 16M (order 12) alignment
remote:  - the CMA region is not 16 M aligned
remote:
remote:  In such a case, can result with the CMA region starting at, say,
remote:  0x2f800000 but any allocation you make from there will be aligned from
remote:  there.  Requesting an allocation of 32 M with 16 M alignment will result
remote:  in an allocation from 0x2f800000 to 0x31800000, which doesn't work very
remote:  well if your strange device requires 16M alignment.
remote:
remote:  Change to use bitmap_find_next_zero_area_off() to account for the
remote:  difference in alignment at reserve-time and alloc-time.

remote:  In the previous commit ("CMA: aggressively allocate the pages on CMA reserved
remote:  memory when not used" by Joonsoo Kim), CMA allocation is changed to be based on
remote:  the total number of "normal" managed pages and the number of managed (aka not
remote:  CMA-allocated) CMA pages.  This was intended to be used in conjunction with a
remote:  commit "CMA: always treat free cma pages as non-free on watermark checking"[1].
remote:  However, including that change results in a severe limitation that cannot be
remote:  used on brcmstb with the current setup: it restricts the amount of CMA region
remote:  memory to be less than or equal to to one-half of the system memory.
remote:
remote:  Rather than applying that change, this alters the heuristic from the
remote:  previous commit: we change the definition of "normal" manages in a zone from
remote:
remote:    total pages - managed (unallocated) CMA pages - high_wmark_pages(zone)
remote:
remote:  to
remote:
remote:    total pages - total CMA pages
remote:
remote:  This eliminates the need to handle determining whether an allocation should
remote:  succeed or fail based on the watermark check, and allows for memory in CMA
remote:  regions to be used for movable allocations even if there isn't any extra room
remote:  to migrate them out of the CMA region.
remote:
remote:  The obvious and rather large caveat is that in the event of a CMA allocation
remote:  actually requiring that space, there might not be enough space available to
remote:  which to move the used pages in the CMA region, resulting in potentially
remote:  catastrophic CMA allocation failures.  Whereas Joonsoo's commit prevents that
remote:  by design but restricts CMA usage, this maintains flexibility for CMA region
remote:  use but leaves it to the system designer to handle CMA allocation failure.

remote:  [Retrieved from
remote:  https://github.com/JoonsooKim/linux/commit/33a0416b3ac1cd7c88e6b35ee61b4a81a7a14afc]
remote:
remote:  CMA is introduced to provide physically contiguous pages at runtime.
remote:  For this purpose, it reserves memory at boot time. Although it reserve
remote:  memory, this reserved memory can be used for movable memory allocation
remote:  request. This usecase is beneficial to the system that needs this CMA
remote:  reserved memory infrequently and it is one of main purpose of
remote:  introducing CMA.
remote:
remote:  But, there is a problem in current implementation. The problem is that
remote:  it works like as just reserved memory approach. The pages on CMA reserved
remote:  memory are hardly used for movable memory allocation. This is caused by
remote:  combination of allocation and reclaim policy.
remote:
remote:  The pages on CMA reserved memory are allocated if there is no movable
remote:  memory, that is, as fallback allocation. So the time this fallback
remote:  allocation is started is under heavy memory pressure. Although it is under
remote:  memory pressure, movable allocation easily succeed, since there would be
remote:  many pages on CMA reserved memory. But this is not the case for unmovable
remote:  and reclaimable allocation, because they can't use the pages on CMA
remote:  reserved memory. These allocations regard system's free memory as
remote:  (free pages - free CMA pages) on watermark checking, that is, free
remote:  unmovable pages + free reclaimable pages + free movable pages. Because
remote:  we already exhausted movable pages, only free pages we have are unmovable
remote:  and reclaimable types and this would be really small amount. So watermark
remote:  checking would be failed. It will wake up kswapd to make enough free
remote:  memory for unmovable and reclaimable allocation and kswapd will do.
remote:  So before we fully utilize pages on CMA reserved memory, kswapd start to
remote:  reclaim memory and try to make free memory over the high watermark. This
remote:  watermark checking by kswapd doesn't take care free CMA pages so many
remote:  movable pages would be reclaimed. After then, we have a lot of movable
remote:  pages again, so fallback allocation doesn't happen again. To conclude,
remote:  amount of free memory on meminfo which includes free CMA pages is moving
remote:  around 512 MB if I reserve 512 MB memory for CMA.
remote:
remote:  I found this problem on following experiment.
remote:
remote:  4 CPUs, 1024 MB, VIRTUAL MACHINE
remote:  make -j16
remote:
remote:  CMA reserve:            0 MB            512 MB
remote:  Elapsed-time:           225.2           472.5
remote:  Average-MemFree:        322490 KB       630839 KB
remote:
remote:  To solve this problem, I can think following 2 possible solutions.
remote:  1. allocate the pages on CMA reserved memory first, and if they are
remote:     exhausted, allocate movable pages.
remote:  2. interleaved allocation: try to allocate specific amounts of memory
remote:     from CMA reserved memory and then allocate from free movable memory.
remote:
remote:  I tested #1 approach and found the problem. Although free memory on
remote:  meminfo can move around low watermark, there is large fluctuation on free
remote:  memory, because too many pages are reclaimed when kswapd is invoked.
remote:  Reason for this behaviour is that successive allocated CMA pages are
remote:  on the LRU list in that order and kswapd reclaim them in same order.
remote:  These memory doesn't help watermark checking from kwapd, so too many
remote:  pages are reclaimed, I guess.
remote:
remote:  So, I implement #2 approach.
remote:  One thing I should note is that we should not change allocation target
remote:  (movable list or CMA) on each allocation attempt, since this prevent
remote:  allocated pages to be in physically succession, so some I/O devices can
remote:  be hurt their performance. To solve this, I keep allocation target
remote:  in at least pageblock_nr_pages attempts and make this number reflect
remote:  ratio, free pages without free CMA pages to free CMA pages. With this
remote:  approach, system works very smoothly and fully utilize the pages on
remote:  CMA reserved memory.

remote:  There is no difference if we don't have CMA reserved memory (0 MB case).
remote:  But, with CMA reserved memory (512 MB case), we fully utilize these
remote:  reserved memory through this patch and the system behaves like as
remote:  it doesn't reserve any memory.
remote:
remote:  With this patch, we aggressively allocate the pages on CMA reserved memory
remote:  so latency of CMA can arise. Below is the experimental result about
remote:  latency.
remote:
remote:  4 CPUs, 1024 MB, VIRTUAL MACHINE
remote:  CMA reserve: 512 MB
remote:  Backgound Workload: make -jN
remote:  Real Workload: 8 MB CMA allocation/free 20 times with 5 sec interval
remote:
remote:  N:                    1        4       8        16
remote:  Elapsed-time(Before): 4309.75  9511.09 12276.1  77103.5
remote:  Elapsed-time(After):  5391.69 16114.1  19380.3  34879.2
remote:
remote:  So generally we can see latency increase. Ratio of this increase
remote:  is rather big - up to 70%. But, under the heavy workload, it shows
remote:  latency decrease - up to 55%. This may be worst-case scenario, but
remote:  reducing it would be important for some system, so, I can say that
remote:  this patch have advantages and disadvantages in terms of latency.
remote:
remote:  Although I think that this patch is right direction for CMA, there is
remote:  side-effect in following case. If there is small memory zone and CMA
remote:  occupys most of them, LRU for this zone would have many CMA pages. When
remote:  reclaim is started, these CMA pages would be reclaimed, but not counted
remote:  for watermark checking, so too many CMA pages could be reclaimed
remote:  unnecessarily. Until now, this can't happen because free CMA pages aren't
remote:  used easily. But, with this patch, free CMA pages are used easily so
remote:  this problem can be possible. I will handle it on another patchset
remote:  after some investigating.
remote:
remote:  v2:
remote:    - In fastpath, just replenish counters. Calculation is done whenver
remote:      CMA area is varied
remote:
remote:  v3:
remote:    - Use unsigned type in adjust_managed_cma_page_count() (per Gioh)
remote:    - Fix +/- count when calling adjust_managed_cma_page_count() (per Gioh)
remote:    - Instead of implementing __rmqueue_cma() which has another
remote:      __rmqueue_smallest(), choose_rmqueue_migratetype() is implemented to
remote:      change original migratetype to MIGRATE_CMA according to criteria. It
remote:      helps not to violate layering. (per Minchan in offline discussion)

remote:  [Upstream submission (not yet accepted) https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/5/28/113]
remote:
remote:  We already have retry logic in migrate_pages(). It does retry 10 times.
remote:  So if we keep this retrying code in __alloc_contig_migrate_range(), we
remote:  would try to migrate some unmigratable page in 50 times. There is just one
remote:  small difference in -ENOMEM case. migrate_pages() don't do retry
remote:  in this case, however, current __alloc_contig_migrate_range() does. But,
remote:  I think that this isn't problem, because in this case, we may fail again
remote:  with same reason.

remote:  [Upstream commit 3c605096d3158216ba9326a16266f6ba128c2c8d]
remote:
remote:  Current pageblock isolation logic could isolate each pageblock
remote:  individually.  This causes freepage accounting problem if freepage with
remote:  pageblock order on isolate pageblock is merged with other freepage on
remote:  normal pageblock.  We can prevent merging by restricting max order of
remote:  merging to pageblock order if freepage is on isolate pageblock.
remote:
remote:  A side-effect of this change is that there could be non-merged buddy
remote:  freepage even if finishing pageblock isolation, because undoing
remote:  pageblock isolation is just to move freepage from isolate buddy list to
remote:  normal buddy list rather than to consider merging.  So, the patch also
remote:  makes undoing pageblock isolation consider freepage merge.  When
remote:  un-isolation, freepage with more than pageblock order and it's buddy are
remote:  checked.  If they are on normal pageblock, instead of just moving, we
remote:  isolate the freepage and free it in order to get merged.

remote:  [Upstream commit 51bb1a4093cc68bc16b282548d9cee6104be0ef1]
remote:
remote:  In free_pcppages_bulk(), we use cached migratetype of freepage to
remote:  determine type of buddy list where freepage will be added.  This
remote:  information is stored when freepage is added to pcp list, so if
remote:  isolation of pageblock of this freepage begins after storing, this
remote:  cached information could be stale.  In other words, it has original
remote:  migratetype rather than MIGRATE_ISOLATE.
remote:
remote:  There are two problems caused by this stale information.
remote:
remote:  One is that we can't keep these freepages from being allocated.
remote:  Although this pageblock is isolated, freepage will be added to normal
remote:  buddy list so that it could be allocated without any restriction.  And
remote:  the other problem is incorrect freepage accounting.  Freepages on
remote:  isolate pageblock should not be counted for number of freepage.
remote:
remote:  Following is the code snippet in free_pcppages_bulk().
remote:
remote:      /* MIGRATE_MOVABLE list may include MIGRATE_RESERVEs */
remote:      __free_one_page(page, page_to_pfn(page), zone, 0, mt);
remote:      trace_mm_page_pcpu_drain(page, 0, mt);
remote:      if (likely(!is_migrate_isolate_page(page))) {
remote:          __mod_zone_page_state(zone, NR_FREE_PAGES, 1);
remote:          if (is_migrate_cma(mt))
remote:              __mod_zone_page_state(zone, NR_FREE_CMA_PAGES, 1);
remote:      }
remote:
remote:  As you can see above snippet, current code already handle second
remote:  problem, incorrect freepage accounting, by re-fetching pageblock
remote:  migratetype through is_migrate_isolate_page(page).
remote:
remote:  But, because this re-fetched information isn't used for
remote:  __free_one_page(), first problem would not be solved.  This patch try to
remote:  solve this situation to re-fetch pageblock migratetype before
remote:  __free_one_page() and to use it for __free_one_page().
remote:
remote:  In addition to move up position of this re-fetch, this patch use
remote:  optimization technique, re-fetching migratetype only if there is isolate
remote:  pageblock.  Pageblock isolation is rare event, so we can avoid
remote:  re-fetching in common case with this optimization.
remote:
remote:  This patch also correct migratetype of the tracepoint output.

remote:  [Upstream commit ad53f92eb416d81e469fa8ea57153e59455e7175]
remote:
remote:  Before describing bugs itself, I first explain definition of freepage.
remote:
remote:   1. pages on buddy list are counted as freepage.
remote:   2. pages on isolate migratetype buddy list are *not* counted as freepage.
remote:   3. pages on cma buddy list are counted as CMA freepage, too.
remote:
remote:  Now, I describe problems and related patch.
remote:
remote:  Patch 1: There is race conditions on getting pageblock migratetype that
remote:  it results in misplacement of freepages on buddy list, incorrect
remote:  freepage count and un-availability of freepage.
remote:
remote:  Patch 2: Freepages on pcp list could have stale cached information to
remote:  determine migratetype of buddy list to go.  This causes misplacement of
remote:  freepages on buddy list and incorrect freepage count.
remote:
remote:  Patch 4: Merging between freepages on different migratetype of
remote:  pageblocks will cause freepages accouting problem.  This patch fixes it.
remote:
remote:  Without patchset [3], above problem doesn't happens on my CMA allocation
remote:  test, because CMA reserved pages aren't used at all.  So there is no
remote:  chance for above race.
remote:
remote:  With patchset [3], I did simple CMA allocation test and get below
remote:  result:
remote:
remote:   - Virtual machine, 4 cpus, 1024 MB memory, 256 MB CMA reservation
remote:   - run kernel build (make -j16) on background
remote:   - 30 times CMA allocation(8MB * 30 = 240MB) attempts in 5 sec interval
remote:   - Result: more than 5000 freepage count are missed
remote:
remote:  With patchset [3] and this patchset, I found that no freepage count are
remote:  missed so that I conclude that problems are solved.
remote:
remote:  On my simple memory offlining test, these problems also occur on that
remote:  environment, too.
remote:
remote:  This patch (of 4):
remote:
remote:  There are two paths to reach core free function of buddy allocator,
remote:  __free_one_page(), one is free_one_page()->__free_one_page() and the
remote:  other is free_hot_cold_page()->free_pcppages_bulk()->__free_one_page().
remote:  Each paths has race condition causing serious problems.  At first, this
remote:  patch is focused on first type of freepath.  And then, following patch
remote:  will solve the problem in second type of freepath.
remote:
remote:  In the first type of freepath, we got migratetype of freeing page
remote:  without holding the zone lock, so it could be racy.  There are two cases
remote:  of this race.
remote:
remote:   1. pages are added to isolate buddy list after restoring orignal
remote:      migratetype
remote:
remote:      CPU1                                   CPU2
remote:
remote:      get migratetype => return MIGRATE_ISOLATE
remote:      call free_one_page() with MIGRATE_ISOLATE
remote:
remote:                                  grab the zone lock
remote:                                  unisolate pageblock
remote:                                  release the zone lock
remote:
remote:      grab the zone lock
remote:      call __free_one_page() with MIGRATE_ISOLATE
remote:      freepage go into isolate buddy list,
remote:      although pageblock is already unisolated
remote:
remote:  This may cause two problems.  One is that we can't use this page anymore
remote:  until next isolation attempt of this pageblock, because freepage is on
remote:  isolate buddy list.  The other is that freepage accouting could be wrong
remote:  due to merging between different buddy list.  Freepages on isolate buddy
remote:  list aren't counted as freepage, but ones on normal buddy list are
remote:  counted as freepage.  If merge happens, buddy freepage on normal buddy
remote:  list is inevitably moved to isolate buddy list without any consideration
remote:  of freepage accouting so it could be incorrect.
remote:
remote:   2. pages are added to normal buddy list while pageblock is isolated.
remote:      It is similar with above case.
remote:
remote:  This also may cause two problems.  One is that we can't keep these
remote:  freepages from being allocated.  Although this pageblock is isolated,
remote:  freepage would be added to normal buddy list so that it could be
remote:  allocated without any restriction.  And the other problem is same as
remote:  case 1, that it, incorrect freepage accouting.
remote:
remote:  This race condition would be prevented by checking migratetype again
remote:  with holding the zone lock.  Because it is somewhat heavy operation and
remote:  it isn't needed in common case, we want to avoid rechecking as much as
remote:  possible.  So this patch introduce new variable, nr_isolate_pageblock in
remote:  struct zone to check if there is isolated pageblock.  With this, we can
remote:  avoid to re-check migratetype in common case and do it only if there is
remote:  isolated pageblock or migratetype is MIGRATE_ISOLATE.  This solve above
remote:  mentioned problems.
remote:
remote:  Changes from v3:
remote:  Add one more check in free_one_page() that checks whether migratetype is
remote:  MIGRATE_ISOLATE or not. Without this, abovementioned case 1 could happens.

remote:  [Upstream commit 16195ddd4ebcc10c30b2f232f8e400df8d464380]
remote:
remote:  Commit 95b0e655f914 ("ARM: mm: don't limit default CMA region only to
remote:  low memory") extended CMA memory reservation to allow usage of high
remote:  memory. It relied on commit f7426b983a6a ("mm: cma: adjust address limit
remote:  to avoid hitting low/high memory boundary") to ensure that the reserved
remote:  block never crossed the low/high memory boundary. While the
remote:  implementation correctly lowered the limit, it failed to consider the
remote:  case where the base..limit range crossed the low/high memory boundary
remote:  with enough space on each side to reserve the requested size on either
remote:  low or high memory.
remote:
remote:  Rework the base and limit adjustment to fix the problem. The function
remote:  now starts by rejecting the reservation altogether for fixed
remote:  reservations that cross the boundary, tries to reserve from high memory
remote:  first and then falls back to low memory.

remote:  [Upstream commit 800a85d3d286604b8c539ca7ee90b992316fd2a7]
remote:
remote:  The fixed parameter to cma_declare_contiguous() tells the function
remote:  whether the given base address must be honoured or should be considered
remote:  as a hint only. The API considers a zero base address as meaning any
remote:  base address, which must never be considered as a fixed value.
remote:
remote:  Part of the implementation correctly checks both fixed and base != 0,
remote:  but two locations check the fixed value only. Set fixed to false when
remote:  base is 0 to fix that and simplify the code.

remote:  [Upstream commit 68faed630fc151a7a1c4853df00fb3dcacf782b4]
remote:
remote:  The current cma bitmap aligned mask computation is incorrect.  It could
remote:  cause an unexpected alignment when using cma_alloc() if the wanted align
remote:  order is larger than cma->order_per_bit.
remote:
remote:  Take kvm for example (PAGE_SHIFT = 12), kvm_cma->order_per_bit is set to
remote:  6.  When kvm_alloc_rma() tries to alloc kvm_rma_pages, it will use 15 as
remote:  the expected align value.  After using the current implementation however,
remote:  we get 0 as cma bitmap aligned mask other than 511.
remote:
remote:  This patch fixes the cma bitmap aligned mask calculation.

remote:  [Upstream commit f7426b983a6a353cf21e5733e84458219c4a817e]
remote:
remote:  Russell King recently noticed that limiting default CMA region only to low
remote:  memory on ARM architecture causes serious memory management issues with
remote:  machines having a lot of memory (which is mainly available as high
remote:  memory).  More information can be found the following thread:
remote:  http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.ports.arm.kernel/348441/
remote:
remote:  Those two patches removes this limit letting kernel to put default CMA
remote:  region into high memory when this is possible (there is enough high memory
remote:  available and architecture specific DMA limit fits).
remote:
remote:  This should solve strange OOM issues on systems with lots of RAM (i.e.
remote:  >1GiB) and large (>256M) CMA area.
remote:
remote:  This patch (of 2):
remote:
remote:  Automatically allocated regions should not cross low/high memory boundary,
remote:  because such regions cannot be later correctly initialized due to spanning
remote:  across two memory zones.  This patch adds a check for this case and a
remote:  simple code for moving region to low memory if automatically selected
remote:  address might not fit completely into high memory.

remote:  [Upstream commit a254129e8686bff7a340b58f35241b04927e81c0]
remote:
remote:  Currently, there are two users on CMA functionality, one is the DMA
remote:  subsystem and the other is the KVM on powerpc.  They have their own code
remote:  to manage CMA reserved area even if they looks really similar.  From my
remote:  guess, it is caused by some needs on bitmap management.  KVM side wants
remote:  to maintain bitmap not for 1 page, but for more size.  Eventually it use
remote:  bitmap where one bit represents 64 pages.
remote:
remote:  When I implement CMA related patches, I should change those two places
remote:  to apply my change and it seem to be painful to me.  I want to change
remote:  this situation and reduce future code management overhead through this
remote:  patch.
remote:
remote:  This change could also help developer who want to use CMA in their new
remote:  feature development, since they can use CMA easily without copying &
remote:  pasting this reserved area management code.
remote:
remote:  In previous patches, we have prepared some features to generalize CMA
remote:  reserved area management and now it's time to do it.  This patch moves
remote:  core functions to mm/cma.c and change DMA APIs to use these functions.
remote:
remote:  There is no functional change in DMA APIs.

remote:  [Upstream commit 5ea3b1b2f8ad9162684431ce6188102ca4c64b7a]
remote:
remote:  Currently, "cma=" kernel parameter is used to specify the size of CMA,
remote:  but we can't specify where it is located.  We want to locate CMA below
remote:  4GB for devices only supporting 32-bit addressing on 64-bit systems
remote:  without iommu.
remote:
remote:  This enables to specify the placement of CMA by extending "cma=" kernel
remote:  parameter.
remote:
remote:  Examples:
remote:   1. locate 64MB CMA below 4GB by "cma=64M@0-4G"
remote:   2. locate 64MB CMA exact at 512MB by "cma=64M@512M"
remote:
remote:  Note that the DMA contiguous memory allocator on x86 assumes that
remote:  page_address() works for the pages to allocate.  So this change requires
remote:  to limit end address of contiguous memory area upto max_pfn_mapped to
remote:  prevent from locating it on highmem area by the argument of
remote:  dma_contiguous_reserve().

remote:  [Upstream commit 7ee793a62fa8c544f8b844e6e87b2d8e8836b219]
remote:
remote:  CMA locking is currently very coarse. The cma_mutex protects both
remote:  the bitmap and avoids concurrency with alloc_contig_range. There
remote:  are several situations which may result in a deadlock on the CMA
remote:  mutex currently, mostly involving AB/BA situations with alloc and
remote:  free. Fix this issue by protecting the bitmap with a mutex per CMA
remote:  region and use the existing mutex for protecting against concurrency
remote:  with alloc_contig_range.
